			<p class="tx">Demand for gluten-free products has exploded worldwide in the last five years. In 2014, the worldwide demand for gluten-free products was 2.8 billion dollars—by 2021 that number is expected to reach 4.8 billion dollars.<sup>1</sup> But what exactly does it mean for a product to be gluten free? Gluten is a substance that holds together the proteins in wheat, rye, and barley. The catalyst for the gluten-free market was the treatment of celiac disease, which affects just over three million Americans. Those with celiac disease must cut gluten from their diet to maintain a healthy lifestyle. But how did a disease that affects only 1% of Americans completely change aggregate demand?</p>
			<p class="tx">In 1997, the average American consumed 147 lbs of wheat per year. That number declined rapidly to 137 lbs per person in the early 2000s with the advent of the Atkins diet, only to rise again in 2007. In 2015 the average American only consumed 133 lbs of wheat per person, an almost 10% drop from what we consumed 20 years ago. It’s apparent that the catalyst of celiac disease has also affected those without the disease, as more and more people have perceived health benefits in a gluten-free diet. Smart companies must adjust to this change in aggregate demand. Gluten-free pizzas and items on the menu at restaurants are a big step in the right direction. If you want to succeed in a tough market such as the United States you have to be ready for the next wave and the next change in aggregate demand.</p>

			<h1 id="ch06sec6.1" class="h1"><span class="sec-number">6.1 </span><span class="sec-title">Aggregate Demand</span></h1>
			<p class="tx">When you think of demand, you probably think of the kinds of demand curves for individual products developed in Chapter 3. <b>Aggregate demand</b> is just that, the combined set of all goods and services produced in an economy and the average prices of those goods and services. More formally, it is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time and price level. <b>Aggregate supply</b>, on the other hand, is the total amount of goods and services that firms are willing to sell at a given price level during a specific time period in an economy.</p>
			<p class="tx">A market demand curve shows the quantity of a single product consumers will buy at various prices, all else being equal. The <b>aggregate demand (AD) curve</b> shows the quantity of total real output that all buyers in an economy will purchase at various price levels. Figure 6.1 shows an AD curve. On the vertical axis, <i>P</i> represents the price level. On the horizontal axis, <i>Y</i> represents real output, or the value of output adjusted for changes in the price level. Economists generally believe that the AD curve has a negative slope, as pictured in Figure 6.1. For convenience, we will assume that the AD curve is linear, or a straight line, for the purpose of the figures in this chapter, even though the AD curve may be somewhat curved, like the downward slope of a skateboard ramp.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer252" class="figure-box">
					<h4 class="figure-name">Figure 6.1: Aggregate demand</h4>
					<p class="caption">An AD curve shows a negative relationship between the price level (<i>P</i>) and real output (<i>Y</i>).</p>
					<div>
						<div id="_idContainer251" class="figure-thin">
							<img src="../Images/pat85286_f0601.jpg" alt="Figure shows the negative relationship between the price level and real output." title="Figure shows the negative relationship between the price level and real output."/>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="tx">The x-axis is labeled with the symbol <i>Y</i>. Economists use <i>Y</i> to represent the flow of output (GDP), which is roughly equal to the flow of NI. Nominal GDP or NI is then the product of <i>P</i> and <i>Y</i> at any point. For example, at point <i>A</i> in Figure 6.1, a price level of 3 and total output of 1,000 combine for a nominal GDP of $3,000. Imagine that <i>Y</i> represents a real, physical quantity, such as cars, pizzas, movie tickets, music downloads, and college tuition all totaled together. The value of those goods and services has to be measured in dollars because that is the only way to aggregate across different products.</p>
			<p class="tx">Notice that aggregate demand is shown with a downward-sloping, or negative, slope in Figure 6.1. People tend to be reluctant to buy as much real output at higher price levels as they do at lower ones. This is especially true if prices rise ahead of wages or if prices increase more rapidly than wages or income. A negative slope of the AD curve implies that higher prices have a negative effect on planned purchases of real output.</p>
			<h2 class="h2">The Price Level and Downward Sloping Aggregate Demand</h2>
			<h3 class="h3">Taxes</h3>
			<p class="tx">If the price level rises, nominal income (<i>P</i> × <i>Y</i>) will increase, even if <i>real</i> income (<i>Y</i>) is unchanged. When nominal income increases and the tax code is progressive, then tax revenues rise more than the increase in income. Households’ disposable incomes fall relative to total real income and output. Higher taxes, by reducing disposable income, reduce people’s ability to buy at higher prices.</p>
			<h3 class="h3">Financial Assets</h3>
			<p class="tx">Higher prices reduce the purchasing power of financial assets owned by households. These assets include savings accounts, bonds, certificates of deposit, pension funds, and insurance policies. When the price level increases, the real purchasing power of financial assets falls, making households feel poorer. A decrease in wealth, real or perceived, means that households are less willing to purchase more goods and services at every level of real income (<i>Y</i>).</p>
			<h3 class="h3">Interest Rates</h3>
			<p class="tx">First, higher price levels are associated with higher interest rates, for reasons we will explore in later chapters. Rising interest rates increase the opportunity cost of borrowing by businesses for investing, by households for purchasing consumer durables, and by state and local governments for financing construction. Lower price levels lead to lower interest rates and more of all three of these kinds of borrowing and spending.</p>
			<h3 class="h3">Net Exports</h3>
			<p class="tx">When there is inflation, usually exports fall and imports rise. The resulting change in net exports (<i>X</i> – <i>M</i>) will change quantity demanded. Higher domestic prices mean that a country’s exports become more expensive to foreigners. Also, imports become more attractive to residents of the country because they are relatively cheaper. Both foreigners and residents will substitute cheaper foreign products for more expensive domestic ones, reducing exports and increasing imports. A fall in net exports means that real quantity demanded is lower at a higher price level. Conversely, a lower price level, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, will lead to substitution of domestic products for foreign products. Then real quantity demanded will be greater at lower price levels.</p>
			<p class="tx">All of the elements described here—household wealth, taxes, financial assets, interest rates, and net exports—support the notion of a downward-sloping AD curve. All of these effects tend to work in the same direction, yielding an AD curve that slopes downward from left to right.</p>

			<h1 id="ch06sec6.2" class="h1"><span class="sec-number">6.2 </span><span class="sec-title">Aggregate Supply</span></h1>
			<p class="tx">The <b>aggregate supply (AS) curve</b> is the relationship between the quantity of total real output supplied and the price level when all other factors influencing production plans are held constant. When the price level rises, the quantity of real GDP supplied increases, and when the price level falls, the quantity of real GDP supplied falls.</p>
			<h2 class="h2">The Slope of the AS Curve</h2>
			<p class="tx">What is the slope of the AS curve? The answer is, it depends. It depends on how firms and owners of resources respond to changes in the price level and how quickly they are able to react and make adjustments. Because it takes time to shift production plans, time plays an even more important role with respect to aggregate supply than with respect to aggregate demand. The dispute over the slope often centers on the difference between what the AS curve looks like in the short run, when firms are only able to make small changes to business plans using existing structures, versus the long run, when firms can demolish, build, be reconstructed or born anew in order to meet the needs of an economy.</p>
			<p class="tx">Because the market supply curve for an individual good slopes upward, you might expect that the AS curve will also slope up from left to right, like line <i>AS</i> shown in Figure 6.2(a). In general, as firms try to produce more output with given resources, some labor has to work overtime at higher pay, driving up costs and prices. Firms are working their capital harder, so it wears out faster and breaks down more often. Competition among producers for scarce resources drives up wages and interest rates. All of these cost increases, for individual products and for aggregate real output, will be reflected in higher prices.</p>

(b) The classical aggregate supply curve, with the economy producing at capacity (or the full-employment level of output, <i>Y</i>*).

					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="tx">Another reason for an upward-sloping supply curve, either for a single product or for goods and services in the aggregate, is that the lure of higher prices will induce producers to try to expand output. If firms and entrepreneurs can sell their products for higher prices, and if their overall costs have not risen as much as the prices of what they sell, they can make more profit. Profit is the incentive and the reward to which producers respond. If higher prices do indeed mean higher profits, then the AS curve will slope upward.</p>
			<h3 class="h3">Classical Macroeconomics and the Vertical AS Curve</h3>
			<p class="tx">What if aggregate supply was a vertical line, running straight up and down? This slope indicates that output does not respond at all to changes in the price level (it is important to remember that output is a real number). Prior to the 1930s most economists believed that the economy naturally tended toward the level of output that available resources could support. There was really only one level of real output that could occur in a properly functioning economic system, where supply and demand in labor markets assured full employment. This real output level was defined as the full-employment level of output, or capacity output. The full-employment level of output is the level of real output associated with full use of all resources, especially labor.</p>
			<p class="tx">Figure 6.2(b) shows the AS curve (<i>AS</i>) as a vertical line. This version of aggregate supply is usually referred to as a <b>classical aggregate supply curve</b> because pre-1930s macroeconomics has been labeled classical macroeconomics. In this model the price level can vary, but changes in the price level will have no effect on real output. A fixed real output level and a variable price level imply a vertical AS curve.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="tx">John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), the British economist whose writings in the 1930s had a large influence on 20th-century macroeconomic theory and policy, offered a third view of the AS curve. He suggested that during periods when large amounts of resources were unemployed, the AS curve could be horizontal, as in Figure 6.2(c). It would be possible for firms to increase both individual and aggregate output without driving the price level above <i>P</i><sub>0</sub>. They could produce more simply by putting unemployed resources to work. Firms would not have to pay higher prices to compete for scarce resources. They could simply hire idle workers at the going wage and use their factories’ idle capacity. A horizontal AS curve implies that the economy is inside its production possibilities curve because there is unemployed labor (and other resources) willing to work at the present wage.</p>
			<h3 class="h3">A Composite View</h3>
			<p class="tx">These different views of the AS curve are sometimes combined in a composite version with three distinct regions, shown in Figure 6.3. The composite view combines elements of both classical and Keynesian theories. The horizontal region (sometimes known as the Keynesian region) represents a situation in which there are ample idle resources. In this case, output can be increased without driving up prices. This segment corresponds to the Keynesian AS curve of Figure 6.2(c).</p>
			<p class="tx">In the intermediate, upward-sloping region of the composite AS curve, there are some unemployed resources. Perhaps they are not the right kind for the mix of additional output that firms are trying to produce. Attempting to expand output in this situation will drive up the price level but will also result in more output. This segment corresponds to the upward-sloping curve of Figure 6.2(a).</p>
			<p class="tx">The last (or classical) segment of the composite AS curve shows what happens when there are no unemployed resources. It is possible to produce more of good A only by cutting output of good B. As producers of A try to bid resources away from other uses, they drive up prices and reduce output of other goods. In this region, the economy is on the production possibilities curve. Attempts to expand total real output will only drive up the price level. This segment corresponds to the vertical (classical) AS curve of Figure 6.2(b).</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<h2 class="h2">Short-Run and Long-Run Perspectives</h2>
			<p class="tx">The composite AS curve is one way to reconcile the conflicting views of how the graph should look. Another way of reconciling these conflicting views is to clarify what is meant by the short run and the long run. Part of the debate between Keynes and his predecessors (classical economists) is a matter of defining terms. Most economists would agree that in the long run, the level of output will tend toward full employment, which corresponds to a vertical AS curve. However, they disagree about the length of time that separates the short run from the long run. If the dividing line between the short run and the long run is 6 months, a fair amount of unemployment can be tolerated until the economy returns to “normal.” If the dividing line is more like 10 years, people will be less patient. Keynes and his followers pointed to the length and severity of the Great Depression as evidence of how long an economy can deviate from the long-run equilibrium level of output corresponding to full employment of resources.</p>

			<h1 id="ch06sec6.3" class="h1"><span class="sec-number">6.3 </span><span class="sec-title">Macroeconomic Equilibrium and Changes in Equilibrium</span></h1>
			<p class="tx">When the demand curve and supply curve for a specific good are drawn on the same graph, it is possible to determine an equilibrium quantity and price. In the same way, the AD and AS curves together determine the level of real output and the price level.</p>
			<p class="tx">Consider the simplest case, a downward-sloping AD curve and an upward-sloping AS curve. Consider the numerical example illustrated in Figure 6.4. Equilibrium occurs at $18 trillion and a price level of 120. This combination of output and price is equilibrium in the same sense that the intersection of an individual supply curve and demand curve is equilibrium. If firms collectively try to produce any other level of output, market forces will tend to push the economy toward the equilibrium level.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer263" class="figure-box">
					<h4 class="figure-name">Figure 6.4: Equilibrium output and price level</h4>
					<p class="caption">Equilibrium occurs at the intersection of <i>AS</i> and <i>AD</i>. If producers attempt to produce and sell the quantity $19 trillion, they will have unsold output at the corresponding price level in the AS curve, 130.

						<p class="caption">When car dealerships stock an amount of cars that is larger than the equilibrium level, consumers are only willing to purchase that large quantity of output when the price level is much lower. At the higher output level, car dealers will find themselves with unsold cars, and inventories will&#160;increase.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="tx">Suppose that firms try to produce a real output, $19 trillion, that is larger than the equilibrium level of output, $18 trillion. For that level of output, producers will attempt to charge prices that average out to a price level of 130. But consumers are only willing to purchase that large quantity of output, $19 trillion, when the price level is much lower, 110. At a price level of 130, consumers are only willing to buy a total quantity of $17 trillion. At the higher output level, $19&#160;trillion, producers will find themselves with unsold output (an unplanned inventory investment of $19 trillion – $17 trillion) and will have to cut prices. As prices fall, there is less incentive to produce additional output. Real output declines until equilibrium is restored. The opposite process occurs if firms try to produce a real output that is less than the equilibrium level. Excess demand will result in falling inventories, and higher prices will encourage firms to expand production to meet demand and rebuild inventories, restoring equilibrium price and output levels.</p>
			<p class="tx">In Figure 6.4, as in the diagrams for individual markets, the quantity sold and the quantity bought are always equal. Producers may offer quantity $19 trillion at price level 130, but they only sell quantity $17 trillion at that price level. Real GDP, however, is equal to <i>P</i><sub>2</sub> × <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>. The unsold output is counted as inventory investment, and the workers and owners of capital who produced that output receive resource incomes. The NI accounts balance (GDP = NI) whether or not the economy is in equilibrium. In the circular flow model, the unplanned investment that firms make in inventory means that they will reduce their inventories in the near future. When that happens, the size of the flow will shrink back to a sustainable level of 120 × $18 trillion.</p>
			<p class="tx">Changes in real output and price level can result from shifts in either aggregate demand or aggregate supply. These curves can shift if there is a change in any of the other variables besides the price level.</p>
			<h2 class="h2">Shifts in Aggregate Demand</h2>
			<p class="tx">A change in any factor that influences spending plans other than the price level will cause a change in aggregate demand. The primary variables that can shift the AD curve include interest rates, expectations, and other familiar demand shifters. These factors affect <i>AD</i> through changes in the components of demand for real GDP—household consumption, business investment, government spending, and net exports.</p>
			<h3 class="h3">Consumption and Investment Spending</h3>
			<p class="tx">Many of the factors that can shift individual demand curves also affect aggregate demand through consumption spending. These effects are changes in consumer wealth (for reasons other than change in the price level), tastes, population, expectations, and interest rates. An increase in consumption spending because of an increase in wealth or population, a change in tastes, more positive expectations, or lower interest rates will shift aggregate demand to the right. Changes in any of these variables in the opposite direction will shift aggregate demand to the left.</p>
			<h3 class="h3">Expectations and Interest Rates</h3>
			<p class="tx">Business investment spending is strongly influenced by expectations and interest rates. Positive expectations and low interest rates will increase investment spending at every possible price level and shift <i>AD</i> to the right, while pessimistic expectations or high interest rates will shift <i>AD</i> to the left.</p>
			<p class="tx">Another factor that can affect both consumption and investment spending is a change in the money supply. An increase in the money supply means that households and firms have more available funds to spend and will demand a larger real quantity of goods and services at every possible price level, shifting <i>AD</i> to the right. A reduction in the money supply means that households and firms have less available to spend at every possible price level, shifting aggregate demand to the left.</p>
			<h3 class="h3">Government Purchases</h3>
			<p class="tx">Spending by governments is determined largely by factors other than expectations and interest rates, but even governments are sensitive to their economic surroundings. Interest rates affect borrowing by state and local governments to finance construction of roads, schools, hospitals, prisons, libraries, sewer systems, and other public facilities. When interest rates fall, these governments may borrow more and increase their spending on long-term projects, shifting <i>AD</i> to the right. Likewise, when interest rates fall, the federal government finds that its bill for interest on the national debt declines, which frees up funds for other kinds of purchases. Because interest on the debt is a transfer payment, switching those funds to the purchase of goods and services should shift <i>AD</i> to the right. Higher interest rates will have the opposite effect on government purchases. For the most part, however, changes in government spending are determined independently of the factors that may influence spending by households and business firms.</p>
			<h3 class="h3">Net Exports</h3>
			<p class="tx">Finally, changes in exports or imports can have an effect on output, employment, and the price level by shifting aggregate demand. In an economy with a foreign sector, aggregate supply is defined as the supply of goods and services <i>produced</i> in the country, not the supply of goods and services available for consumption. Similarly, aggregate demand is the demand for goods and services produced in the country, whether the consumers are residents or foreigners. Higher exports show up in an aggregate supply and demand diagram as an increase in aggregate demand. Imports are shown as a decrease in aggregate demand rather than an addition to aggregate supply. An increase in exports will shift aggregate demand to the right, while a decrease in exports shifts it to the left.</p>
			<p class="tx">Although the price level is already shown in the diagram of <i>AS</i> and <i>AD</i>, the important consideration for imports and exports is the price level relative to foreign price levels—that is, how prices of U.S. goods compare to prices of foreign goods. An increase in foreign price levels will increase net exports (increase exports, decrease imports) at every possible price level and shift aggregate demand to the right, while a decrease in foreign price levels will reduce net exports and shift aggregate demand to the left. Income and output are also reflected in the diagram of <i>AS</i> and <i>AD</i>, but foreign income is not; changes in foreign income will affect demand for this country’s exports. Higher foreign income will increase demand for exports, shifting <i>AD</i> to the right; lower foreign income will reduce demand for exports, shifting it to the left.</p>
			<p class="tx">One of the most important influences on net exports is the <b>currency exchange rate</b>, or the price of the country’s currency in terms of other currencies. A higher price for the dollar will make foreign goods cheaper and U.S. goods more expensive, reducing U.S. exports, increasing U.S. imports, and shifting <i>AD</i> to the left. If the price rises, the interest rate rises, which also raises the exchange rate. This will increase imports and reduce exports so that net exports will decline. A lower price for the dollar will increase net exports and shift <i>AD</i> to the right.</p>
			<h2 class="h2">The Effects of Shifts in Aggregate Demand</h2>
			<p class="tx">If the AS curve slopes upward, we expect both the price level and output to increase when the AD curve shifts to the right. How much of the shift is in the price level and how much is in real output depends on the slope of the AS curve. In Figure 6.5 the original equilibrium is at 120 and $18 trillion on <i>AD</i><sub>1</sub>. A shift of the curve to <i>AD</i><sub>2</sub> means that people want to purchase more real output at every possible price level. If the AD curve shifted to <i>AD</i><sub>3</sub>, this would mean that people were willing to buy less real output at every possible price level. Both the price level and total real output would fall. When the AD curve shifts, prices and real output move in the same direction.</p>

			<p class="tx">The effect of shifts of the AD curve on real output and the price level is different if the AS curve is horizontal or vertical. Along a horizontal AS curve, increases in aggregate demand drive up real output only. Also, a decline in aggregate demand reduces real output only, with no effect on the price level. With a vertical AS curve, the price level rises when the AD curve shifts to the right and falls when it shifts to the left, but real output does not change. You might experiment with the composite AS curve in Figure 6.3 to observe these different effects on prices and output.</p>
			<p class="tx">Some of the factors that affect individual supply curves, such as the prices of other products the firm could produce, disappear when the horizontal axis measures aggregate output. However, aggregate supply can shift for two of the reasons that individual supply curves shift. One is an increase or decrease in the amount of productive resources available. The other is a change in technology. In addition, there may be shifts in aggregate supply due to special factors such as political scandals, wars, terrorist attacks, or natural disasters, such as the Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2011. Except for wars, most of these shocks are fairly short term or localized in their effects. For example, in 2017 Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a devastating impact on Texas and Florida, respectively, causing upward of $200 billion in damages. Although these natural disasters negatively impacted the local and regional economies for several years, there was relatively little impact on the national economy and a relatively small long-term impact.</p>
			<p class="tx">Policy actions can also affect aggregate supply. Remember, the goal of a firm is to make a profit. When tax laws or other regulations change, they affect the profitability of firms and their willingness to supply output at all price levels. Tax policies can have an impact on both aggregate supply and aggregate demand, although in different ways. Tax breaks that stimulate spending on new capital, development of new capital, or investment in worker training will all shift <i>AS</i> to the right. Policies that reduce interest rates make it easier for firms to borrow and invest in new capital, increasing productivity and shifting <i>AS</i> to the right. Policies that drive up interest rates have the opposite effect.</p>
			<h3 class="h3">Resource Availability</h3>
			<p class="tx">The United States has seen some significant changes in the size, makeup, and skills of the labor force over the past 50 years. Women joining the labor force more consistently and in greater numbers, older generations hitting retirement age, and the level and mix of immigrants evolving have combined to create a very different kind of labor force. The size of the labor force is now a larger fraction of the total population because the share of the population that is in the labor force has risen from 59% in 1960 to 63% in 2018 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018a). In addition, the human capital that those workers bring to the job has changed due to an increase in the level of educational attainment. Adding additional workers or more productive workers (workers with more skills or human capital) will shift <i>AS</i> to the right. A decline in labor force participation or a lower average level of skill and experience will shift it to the left.</p>
			<p class="tx">A second important resource is capital, which comes from the accumulation over time of savings that is invested in plants and equipment. Typically, about 18% of GDP goes into private sector investment—some for replacement, the rest for new equipment and facilities, including not only factories but also housing, shopping malls, and office buildings. An increase in the stock of capital makes workers more productive and shifts <i>AS</i> to the right. However, if capital is not replaced as it ages or wears out, <i>AS</i> could shift to the left.</p>
			<h3 class="h3">Changes in Technology</h3>

				<p class="video-head">3&ndash;D Printing</p>

			<p class="tx">A change in the methods of production can shift <i>AS</i> to the right. Most people are familiar with innovations such as industrial robots that increase the productivity of existing resources. Other changes are often less visible but can still have an impact on the productivity of labor and capital. For example, the latest information technology has been found to increase productivity in most industries. The introduction of the computer in industries in the 1980s revolutionized a variety of tasks in production, ranging from scheduling production to managing inventories. The creation of the Internet changed how people and businesses communicate and operate on a daily basis. More recently, the advent of 3-D printers and increased automatization (think self-driving cars) have changed the demand for labor and different types of labor as a result.</p>

			<p class="tx">The most recent trend is the “greening” of the production process. Companies are now trying to utilize recycling and earth-friendly processes and materials while producing their products. For example, a Subaru plant in Indiana became the first U.S. auto plant to achieve zero-landfill status. “We have sent nothing to a landfill since May 4, 2004,” says senior executive vice president Tom Easterday. “I like to tell people if they go to Starbucks for a cup of coffee, once they throw away that cup, they’ve put more into a landfill than we have in the last 13&#160;years” (as cited in Guynup, 2017, para. 10). Globally, numerous companies have aimed for similar goals. For example, Envoy Textiles in Bangladesh was the first denim-producing green factory in the world.</p>

			<h2 class="h2">The Effects of Shifts in Aggregate Supply</h2>
			<p class="tx">Shifts in aggregate supply are shown in Figure 6.6. For simplicity, we use the upward-sloping AS curve. A shift in aggregate supply to the left (from <i>AS</i><sub>1</sub> to <i>AS</i><sub>2</sub>) means that producers will be willing to supply a smaller quantity of real output at every possible price level <i>or</i> the same real output at a higher price level. Real output falls and the price level rises—the worst of all possible worlds. When aggregate supply shifts to the right (from <i>AS</i><sub>1</sub> to <i>AS</i><sub>3</sub>), the result is the best of all possible worlds—rising real output and a falling price level.</p>

			<h1 id="ch06sec6.4" class="h1"><span class="sec-number">6.4 </span><span class="sec-title">The Classical and Keynesian Traditions and Views in&#160;the 21st Century</span></h1>
			<p class="tx">We can use aggregate supply and aggregate demand to develop an overview of how different economists look at the macroeconomy.</p>
			<p class="tx">Although there are a variety of opinions across economists, there are traditionally two distinctive traditions: the classical and the Keynesian. Some of the differences between these two groups are disagreements over how aggregate demand shifts or whether it can be permanently shifted by government policies. Most of the disagreement, however, centers on the slope of the AS curve and whether the curve can be shifted by public policies.</p>
			<p class="tx">The conflict between these two schools of thought hit a peak during the Great Depression. The outcome of that clash was the Keynesian revolution, which put a new emphasis on aggregate demand and how it could be shifted. As Keynesian policies produced mixed results, new groups of economists challenged Keynes’s emphasis on aggregate demand. Although these groups had a wide range of views, most of them adhered to the classical tradition, emphasizing the long run over the short run and preferring minimum government intervention. Other economists refined and modified ideas in the Keynesian tradition but continued to be concerned about short-run problems and in favor of activist government involvement in the macroeconomy.</p>
			<h2 class="h2">The Classical Tradition</h2>
			<p class="tx">Economists use the term <i>classical school</i> to refer to a diverse group of economists, from David Hume in the 18th century to A. C. Pigou in the early 20th century. What these economists had in common was a belief that the economy automatically tends toward a level of output associated with full employment. Economists in the classical tradition are basically market oriented, aiming for minimal government in their policy recommendations—an approach known as laissez-faire, or “let it be.” They believe that most government economic policies are ineffective, ill timed, or downright harmful and that the market system works best in macroeconomics as well as microeconomics when left alone.</p>
			<p class="tx">Members of this group tend to focus their attention on the long-run AS curve, which they believe is vertical or nearly so. If this is the case, shifting aggregate demand will accomplish little except to change the price level. The important role for policy, if policy has any role at all, is to try to shift aggregate supply to the right. Economists in the classical tradition expect that automatic market forces will always push real output toward the full-employment level. Any attempts to change <i>Y</i> by increasing aggregate demand will only drive up the price level. In Figure 6.7, an increase in aggregate demand from <i>AD</i><sub>1</sub> to <i>AD</i><sub>2</sub> drives the price level up from <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> to <i>P</i><sub>2</sub> but leaves real output unchanged at <i>Y</i>*.</p>

			<p class="tx">Finally, classical economists were primarily concerned with the long run, a time period in which the economy is normally at or near the full-employment level of output. They felt that any deviations from full employment and capacity output would be corrected if only people were flexible and willing to wait for natural market forces to operate. Government intervention in the economy, even on behalf of the worthy goal of full employment, was likely to interfere with the more highly valued microeconomic goals of efficiency and freedom.</p>
			<p class="tx">Contemporary economists in the classical tradition, sometimes referred to as <b>new classical</b> economists, believe that the AS curve is vertical in the long run. Some of them do concede that it can have a positive slope in the short run, although they expect it to be fairly steep. That is, in the short run, the economy could find itself at a level of output <i>Y</i><sub>e</sub> that is below the full-employment level of output, <i>Y</i>*, as shown in Figure 6.8. <b>Neoclassical</b> economics builds microfoundations into the macroeconomic model by considering the microeconomic foundations of the macroeconomy, or how individuals and businesses operate within an economy, rather than trying to make assumptions about aggregate demand.</p>

					<h1 class="h1">Policy Focus: Fiscal Liberals, Fiscal Conservatives, and the In-Between</h1>
					<p class="tx">As you may have noticed, some economists support and others oppose government intervention to promote output growth and reduce unemployment. In general, those who favor a larger role for government in both macroeconomic and microeconomic policy are known as fiscal liberals. Those who wish to minimize the role of government and rely primarily on market processes are labeled fiscal conservatives. It is important to note that an individual who supports a liberal fiscal policy need not be <i>socially</i> liberal, which implies support for the expansion of civil and political rights. A person can be fiscally liberal and socially conservative and vice versa, depending on how the person’s view of government intervention in regulating markets, for example, differs from the government’s role in regulating relationships (such as support for gay marriage).</p>
					<p class="tx">Keynesians are generally fiscally liberal, although there are differences among them. They are concerned about unemployment, somewhat tolerant of inflation, and inclined to look for solutions through government. They are also more inclined to use the political system to change the income distribution toward greater equality—that is, favoring programs giving income or services to the poor. Contemporary representatives of the classical tradition, on the other hand, tend to be fiscally conservative. These economists have much more faith in market processes and much less trust in the ability of government to improve outcomes. They also tend to worry more about inflation than unemployment and to resist using government to redistribute income from the rich to the poor.</p>
					<p class="tx">There are, however, important and subtle differences within and between groups. It is possible to be conservative and to worry about unemployment—to favor policies that create incentives in the private sector to increase output and jobs. Such policies might include less regulation or tax breaks for job creation, while the liberal solution is more likely to involve increased government spending to accomplish the same goal. Nevertheless, these broad categories are helpful in sorting out who is likely to advocate what kind of policy and why.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h2 class="h2">The Keynesian Tradition</h2>
			<p class="tx">Nineteenth-century economists who predated the work of Keynes were called business cycle theorists. Among them were Thomas Robert Malthus and Karl Marx. These economists were concerned about large or prolonged deviations from the full-employment level of output. They challenged the classical view that market forces will return the economy automatically to full employment, because this view did not seem to fit the evidence. Business cycle theorists argued that cyclical ups and downs in output, employment, and prices occurred with such regularity and frequency that they seemed to be obeying some natural law of the marketplace. Such real-world events were not consistent with an AS curve that was vertical. The business cycle theorists’ picture of the economy is captured by Figure 6.9, which shows a fairly flat AS curve. In this model, a shift in aggregate demand from <i>AD</i><sub>1</sub> to <i>AD</i><sub>2</sub> drives the price level up from 120 to 130 but also results in an increase in real output from $18 trillion to $19&#160;trillion. When Keynes tried to explain one of the most severe downturns in economic activity in modern times—the Great Depression—he built on the work of the business cycle theorists.</p>

			<p class="tx">The greatest challenge to the classical school was the business cycle itself at its worst—the Great Depression. “Wait it out, the economy will correct itself” was not appealing advice in the depths of the Depression. Keynes insisted that even if the problems of falling output and unemployment could not last indefinitely, they could last long enough to cause great hardship, lost output, and human suffering.</p>
			<p class="tx">What really set Keynes apart from the classical school was his willingness to sacrifice laissez-faire principles. Unlike classical economists, Keynes thought that government officials could and should intervene to speed up the process of getting back to full employment. He believed that the benefits of intervention in the business cycle would exceed the cost. This argument led to a political revolution with respect to the economic role of government. That change was as important as the intellectual revolution that Keynes’s ideas caused in the field of economics.</p>
			<h2 class="h2">Macroeconomics in the 21st Century</h2>
			<p class="tx">A <b>new Keynesian</b> theory of economics emerged in the 1990s when economists Gregory Mankiw and David Romer edited a compilation called <i>New Keynesian Economics</i>. This school of macroeconomics strives to provide microeconomic foundations for Keynesian economics. New Keynesian economists reiterate that market failures in the aggregate economy create business cycle fluctuations. These fluctuations result in lower GDP and are therefore inefficient. The focus of new Keynesian theory is on “demand shocks,” or changes in aggregate demand, that cause these fluctuations. Like Keynes, new Keynesian economists see an important role for government in smoothing out ups and downs and, in particular, in reducing unemployment by manipulating aggregate demand. The primary difference is that Keynesians would foresee a permanent impact on output, while new Keynesian theory predicts only a temporary output effect. <b>Monetarists</b>, primarily led by Milton Friedman, see the role of the government in smoothing the ups and downs of the business cycle, except they believe the corrections can be done using monetary policy, or the supply of money in the economy. Monetarists would not see a need for fiscal policy in the form of government spending, for example, in an effort to shape the macroeconomy.</p>
			<p class="tx">Another competing school of thought is called <b>real business cycle</b> theory. This theory focuses on “supply shocks,” or changes in aggregate supply, as the primary source of business cycle fluctuations. Real business cycle theory rejects Keynesian principles and, by extension, the effectiveness of monetary policy in smoothing out fluctuations in the economy.</p>
			<p class="tx">In light of the differing views of how the economy operates, and therefore what could or should be done to address economic downturns or periods of high inflation, there is often much debate whenever government actions are proposed.</p>

			<h1 id="ch06summary" class="h1"><span class="sec-number">Conclusion</span></h1>
			<p class="tx">The tools developed in this chapter should enable you to answer the questions posed in the historical example at the beginning of the chapter. Rather than the level of output and the level of prices, which appear in the diagram of aggregate supply and aggregate demand, these questions were expressed in terms of rates of output growth (or decline) and rates of inflation. However, we can still interpret these changes with aggregate supply and aggregate demand. In 1992, when Russia suffered from dramatically falling output (a&#160;13% decline in GDP) and 2,000% inflation, the only explanation in terms of aggregate supply and aggregate demand is that aggregate supply must have shifted to the left. Uncertainty about ownership of property and lack of incentives to work during the transition from communism to a market economy must have discouraged production efforts. The Russian economy rebounded in 2010 and has gone on to maintain a low but stable rate of economic growth on average through 2018.</p>
			<p class="tx">How would you use the tools in this chapter to explain a small amount of growth and steady inflation in the United States? You can see that aggregate supply and demand is a simple and handy economic model for thinking about growth rates and inflation around the world.</p>
			<h2 class="eoc-h2">Key Ideas</h2>
			<ol class="ol">
				<li class="nl">The AD curve shows the amounts of total real output that consumers will buy at various price levels. This curve slopes down from left to right. A higher price level is associated with less demand for real output. This negative relationship is due to the effects of changes in price level on tax revenues, interest rates, exports and imports, and household assets.</li>
				<li class="nl">The AS curve shows the amounts of total real output that the economy will produce at various price levels. An upward-sloping AS curve results from higher costs of production as firms compete for increasingly scarce supplies of resources. Alternatively, an upward-sloping AS curve reflects the incentive that higher profits associated with higher prices give producers to increase output. The AS curve could also be horizontal or vertical. A composite AS curve has a horizontal region at low levels of output, followed by an upward-sloping range, and finally a vertical segment as output reaches capacity</li>
				<li class="nl">Aggregate demand will shift if there is a change in consumption, investment, government spending, or net exports at every price level or if there is a change in the money supply. Aggregate supply will shift if there is a change in resource availability, technology, special factors such as war or earthquakes, or certain kinds of government policies.</li>
				<li class="nl">The primary historical macroeconomic theories were the classical tradition and the Keynesian tradition. Classical economists thought that the economy tended naturally toward full employment. The classical aggregate supply curve was vertical. The classical school advocated a laissez-faire approach. Keynes challenged the classical school during the Great Depression. He suggested that the AS curve could be horizontal, or at least very flat, in the short run. Periods of unemployment could persist for a long time without automatic correction. He advocated government intervention in the form of fiscal policy to shift aggregate demand.</li>
				<li class="nl">Modern macroeconomic theory focuses on either aggregate demand fluctuations (new Keynesian) or technology and aggregate supply fluctuations (real business cycle theory). The primary differences between the two are whether business cycle fluctuations are natural in an economy and whether government intervention is an effective tool in general.</li>
