<h1 class="tablecontent" id="preface">Preface</h1>

<p class="tx">As consumers, we each experience what could be marketing case studies every day. We are exposed to thousands of advertising messages. We develop needs, research solutions, evaluate options, make purchases, and experience satisfaction or disappointment. This makes marketing a particularly stimulating subject for teachers and learners, since its practical application is visible every day.</p>

<p class="tx">The practice of marketing is undergoing unprecedented transformation as the 21st century unfolds. Today&rsquo;s consumers are choosing products and companies for new reasons. They are more aware, more active, and more powerful than they have ever been. The old rules of marketing are no longer useful to those who want to influence these new consumers&rsquo; choices. This textbook explores the leading edge of the paradigm shift that is now underway.</p>

<p class="tx">The book is organized into four areas:</p>

<ol class="nl">
<li class="nl">Introduction to Marketing and Its Processes (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2)</li>
<li class="nl">The Marketing Mix (Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Chapter 6)</li>
<li class="nl">The Marketing Environment (Chapter 7 and Chapter 8)</li>
<li class="nl">Marketing Management (Chapter 9 and Chapter 10)</li>
</ol>

<p class="tx">The logic behind this organization is to first introduce students to the concepts and processes of marketing, to follow that with an exploration of the aspects that are under marketers&rsquo; control, then to broaden the discussion to include the uncontrollable factors of customers and the environment. The final chapters echo the initial introduction but take the student deeper into the work of marketing.</p>

<p class="tx">Figures illustrate concepts as needed to facilitate comprehension. Field Trips link to online content related to topics discussed in each chapter. While not required reading, Field Trips give students an opportunity to apply concepts learned and to observe contemporary marketing in action, in real time. </p>

<p class="tx">Each chapter concludes with a case study and critical thinking questions that allow you, the learner, to apply concepts by drawing on your own life experience.</p>

			<h2 class="h2">Troubleshooting</h2>
			<p class="tx">While every effort has been made to ensure that the links remain viable, you may periodically encounter a broken link or an error message (404 Not Found). In these situations, it is advisable to copy and paste the website name into Google as a new search. Often this will solve the problem caused when an organization reorganizes its website.</p>
			<p class="tx">A specific web page may no longer be available when an organization goes out of business. In this case, paste the URL into the Wayback Machine (<a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php"><span class="hyperlink">http://archive.org/web/web.php</span></a>) to view an archive version of the web page.</p>
