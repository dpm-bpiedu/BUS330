<h1 class="h1" id="ch07intro">Introduction</h1>

<p class="tx">Community corrections programs are vital to the corrections process; they bring more people under correctional authority at any given moment than do jails and prisons combined. At the end of 2016, approximately 6,613,500 adult offenders were under the supervision of U.S. correctional systems&mdash;and nearly 70% were under the authority of community corrections (Kaeble &amp; Cowhig, 2018). Community corrections programs are an essential part of appropriate sentencing for both lesser and serious offenses.</p>

<p class="tx">Without question, probation and parole are the major elements of community corrections; the majority of offenders involved in community corrections fall under the categories of probation or parole/extended release supervision. These are important correctional options that also serve to reduce the strain on jail and prison populations.</p>

<p class="tx">This chapter defines community corrections and discusses two of its primary aims: reintegration and restorative justice. In this chapter, we discuss the notion of &ldquo;community&rdquo; and make observations concerning the implementation of community corrections programs. Furthermore, we discuss common elements of community corrections programming, including diversion, pretrial release, drug courts, house arrest, electronic monitoring, boot camps, restitution, community service, temporary release (e.g., work release), and residential programs/halfway houses. Probation and parole/extended release are discussed in more detail in Chapters 8 and 9, respectively.</p>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec7.1">7.1&ensp;Defining Community Corrections</h1>

<p class="tx">Community corrections is a broad term used to refer to programs that supervise and serve offenders in community settings, both pre- and postconviction. As noted by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ, 2018a), &ldquo;community corrections programs oversee offenders outside of jail or prison, and are administered by agencies or courts with the legal authority to enforce sanctions.&rdquo; Therefore, almost any correctional practice or program, other than those carried out within a prison&rsquo;s facilities, could be deemed a community corrections effort. Whether an effort or program truly counts as community corrections depends on the extent to which corrections personnel collaborate with community organizations and use community resources to facilitate offenders&rsquo; reintegration to society. Since the 1980s two correctional aims have been associated with community corrections, helping distinguish these from corrections that simply occur in a community setting. First, community corrections aim to &ldquo;reintegrate&rdquo; offenders. Second, since the 1990s community corrections have focused on &ldquo;restorative justice.&rdquo; We discuss each of these aims below.</p>

<div class="p-ct">Community corrections requires the community to play a role in helping offenders reintegrate into society. Here, an inmate discusses reintegration with university students. Why do you think the community&rsquo;s involvement is important in such efforts?</div>
</div>


<a id="p161"></a>

<h2 class="h2">Reintegration </h2>

<p class="tx">Reintegration is a conceptual foundation of community corrections. As a correctional aim, it is the process of using opportunities available in the community to help a formerly criminal individual live a law-abiding lifestyle. The individual is encouraged to make good choices that conform to the law. The &ldquo;community&rdquo; collaborates in this process by providing opportunities, such as employment, or assistance, such as with finding housing. It is expected that over time the offender will adopt new attitudes and beliefs that further lead him or her to behave lawfully.</p>

<p class="tx">Community-based programs founded on the notion of reintegration are designed to foster change within an offender. They feature the active involvement of community organizations and resources outside the correctional agency. For many, reintegration means more than simply being law-abiding; it means adopting community values and beliefs while leading an acceptable lifestyle. McCarthy and McCarthy (1984) present several qualities a community-based program must have to achieve the reintegration objective, including the following:</p>

<ul class="nl">
<li class="nl">A location within, and interaction with, a meaningful community.</li>
<li class="nl">A nonsecure environment.</li>
<li class="nl">Community-based education, counseling, and support services (these are provided by noncorrectional public and private agencies, as well as by correctional staff, and are organized into a comprehensive service&ndash;delivery network).</li>
<li class="nl">Opportunities [for the offenders] to assume the normal roles of citizen, family member, student, or employee.</li>
<li class="nl">Opportunities for personal growth.</li>
<li class="nl">Efforts to change the community by encouraging tolerance for non-conforming behavior that is nevertheless law-abiding and developing opportunities for self-sufficiency and self-realization. (p. 8)</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="h3">Challenges to Reintegration</h3>

<p class="tx">American communities are diverse&mdash;and more so the larger and more populated they are. Large metropolitan areas are home to groups with diverse interests and unequal influence, governing agencies with agendas that do not necessarily mesh, and limited resources. In the same city, there live people who have conflicting notions about the purpose of criminal law, whether citizens can play a role in corrections, whether corrections programs should be associated with or located in certain neighborhoods, and what constitutes an acceptable social&nbsp;lifestyle.</p>

<p class="tx">Within this setting are many challenges to realizing offender reintegration. Consider an offender who has been placed on parole (after being released from prison) or one who is given probation and is living below the poverty level. Both likely need employment. In the face of a difficult job market, convicted offenders, especially felons, have trouble finding a job. Some offenders are less employable than others: Some have never held a job, most have a high school education or less, and many lack appropriate social and communication skills, let alone good interview skills. Still others have challenges accessing reliable transportation or child care. Moreover, all felons bear the label of &ldquo;felon.&rdquo; Corrections personnel and offenders must attempt reintegration within diverse community settings that may not be supportive of reintegration efforts or programs. </p>

<a id="p162"></a>

<p class="tx">The Massachusetts Department of Corrections is one institution that works to achieve reintegration in this context. It sees planning for an inmate&rsquo;s reintegration into society as an ongoing process that begins as soon as he or she is committed (Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 2018). Although each inmate&rsquo;s needs vary, the Massachusetts Department of Corrections has identified the following as common reentry needs:</p>

<ol class="bl">
<li class="bl">housing</li>
<li class="bl">continuity of care for medical, mental health, and substance abuse treatment (including making appointments)</li>
<li class="bl">health insurance</li>
<li class="bl">employment (resumes [sic], JobQuest profiles, One Stop Career Center info)</li>
<li class="bl">benefits (info about obtaining food stamps, Social Security and Disability, veteran services)</li>
<li class="bl">probation and parole coordination</li>
<li class="bl">victim and public safety notifications</li>
<li class="bl">obtaining identity documents</li>
<li class="bl">linkages to community resources (Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 2018)</li>
</ol>


<h3 class="h3">Measuring Reintegration</h3>

<p class="tx">In a practical sense, it is very difficult to measure reintegration. What yardstick can be used to determine if an individual has been reintegrated? Keep in mind that most offenders, especially those who committed less serious offenses, do not actually leave the community while under correctional authority. Therefore, reintegration is a concept much larger than simply &ldquo;reentering&rdquo; a community after being away from it in prison. However, reentry programs and services may be used to further the correctional aim of reintegration: </p>

<p class="ext">Reentry programs aim to reduce offender recidivism and successfully reintegrate an offender back into the community. Reentry efforts often begin in prison and transition into the community once a prisoner is released. Typically, reentry services include case management and assistance with housing, education, employment, healthcare, and substance abuse. (NIJ, n.d.b, para 1)</p>

<p class="tx">Some conceive of reintegration as the process by which offenders adjust to the community and adopt its attitudes, beliefs, and lifestyle. In an abstract way, we could think of reintegration as occurring when the offender conforms to an acceptable set of attitudes and beliefs and is assimilated into the community&rsquo;s culture. But as previously stated, communities are very diverse, making it difficult to determine what attitudes, beliefs, and lifestyles should serve as the standards for assimilation. This fact also makes it difficult to measure the extent of an offender&rsquo;s reintegration.</p>

<p class="tx">The usual yardstick for measuring reintegration is whether an offender abides by the law, is not rearrested, and is not reconvicted. In a practical sense, it would be said that a law-abiding offender who meets this criteria has been reintegrated to the community. This perspective takes a legalistic approach; it assumes that law-abiding behavior is the measure and meaning of reintegration. However, that leaves us with a rather narrow understanding of reintegration, which is why there is no consensus concerning a sufficient standard for or measure of it.</p>

</div>

<a id="p163"></a>

<h2 class="h2">Program Design, Operation, and the Community</h2>

<p class="tx">With reintegration as the central, distinguishing aim, we must focus on the nature and extent of community&ndash;correctional programs to determine whether a particular effort counts as community corrections. We must focus on issues such as whether program design and implementation aim to develop ties to the community and rely on local resources&mdash;such as determining whether program personnel are required to develop alliances with community members, private organizations, and public organizations to provide employment possibilities, educational opportunities, medical and counseling services, perhaps citizen involvement (such as volunteer probation officers), and so on. We would likely focus on the degree to which program design and operation are aimed at fostering community change, such as program personnel&rsquo;s direct attempts to educate community members about the community&rsquo;s responsibilities in the general corrections effort, inform local leadership and citizens about conditions that can help the corrections effort, and encourage interactions between programs and the community.</p>

</div>

<p class="tx">If we attempted to judge whether a program was a community corrections effort based solely on the nature and extent of its involvement in community corrections programs, then correctional efforts that exist in community settings yet exhibit few or no such involvements would be outside the umbrella. For example, if a probation agency&rsquo;s personnel only focused on enforcing rules, rarely or never referred people in their caseloads to resources in the community, and did little or nothing to network the agency&rsquo;s resources with the available community resources, we might consider the effort to be something other than community corrections. However, this may be a more semantic issue than a practical one. There is no easily determined standard for judging the nature or extent of involvement. Most community corrections efforts or programs have some planned involvement and make at least tangential use of locally available resources.</p>

<p class="tx">Furthermore, determining the degree of reciprocity (community members&rsquo; willingness to be involved, dedication of resources) would be important in making a distinction. Again, there is no established measurement for judging. It is also important to keep in mind that there are thousands of public and private correctional agencies and organizations throughout the United States. Most operate in jurisdictions that are overburdened with offenders. Some are set in communities that lack resources. Correctional efforts often overlap (e.g., federal, state, and local probation efforts tend to operate concurrently in larger cities), and these entities may cooperate or compete with each other. The same may be true of the community&rsquo;s social service agencies and organizations. Examining community corrections requires one to be aware of this complexity and understand the ambiguity associated with the term and the ideas involved.</p>

<a id="p164"></a>

<h2 class="h2">Restorative Justice </h2>

<p class="tx">The restorative justice movement emerged in the United States and elsewhere in the 1990s. <strong>Restorative justice</strong> approaches aim to repair the harm a crime has done to victims and the community. Offenders are included in this notion; an offender who is restored to the community takes responsibility for the crime and undergoes deep personal change to become a law-abiding and socially acceptable community member (Braithwaite, 1989). Braithwaite (2016) argues that &ldquo;restorative justice is not just about strengthening justice systems or strengthening democracy. It is also about strengthening communities, families and schools, which have profound value in themselves independent of the contributions they make to democracy or justice&rdquo; (p. 8). Restorative justice has become another primary aim of community corrections. According to Strang and Braithwaite (2001), &ldquo;restorative justice is conceived in the literature in two different ways. One is a process conception, the other is a values conception&rdquo; (p. 5).</p>

<p class="tx">Advocates of restorative justice distinguish this perspective and resultant endeavors from the established justice system. Strang and Braithwaite (2001) observe that </p>

<p class="ext">restorative justice [the process conception] is a process that brings together all stakeholders affected by some harm that has been done (e.g., offenders, their families, victims and their families, affected communities, state agencies such as the police). The stakeholders meet in a circle [or a conference] to discuss how they have been affected by the harm. (pp. 5&ndash;6) </p>

<p class="tx">Furthermore, regarding the values conception, Strang and Braithwaite (2001) note that </p>

<p class="ext">it is values that distinguish restorative justice from traditional punitive state justice. Restorative justice is about healing (restoration) rather than hurting. Responding to the hurt of the crime with the hurt of punishment is rejected, along with its corresponding value of proportionality&mdash;punishment that is proportional to the wrong that has been done. (pp. 5&ndash;6)</p>

</div>

<p class="tx">Strang and Braithwaite (2001) explain, &ldquo;In our view it is best to see restorative justice as involving commitment to both restorative processes and values&rdquo; (p. 11). They see two continua: for values &ldquo;there can be more or less restoration&rdquo; (p. 11); for processes there can be a range &ldquo;from formal courtroom processing that involves no attempt to empower the voices of the stakeholders to mediation that involves only two stakeholders [e.g., offender and victim], to whole-of-community healing circles&rdquo; (p. 11). </p>

<p class="tx">McDonald (2018) explores restorative justice efforts in the Missouri Department of Corrections and considers the purpose of these efforts, including potential benefits for offenders, which may include developing valuable perspectives on how their actions affected others. McDonald notes (2018), with regard to offenders, that &ldquo;instead of thinking of the past, they are looking toward the future and asking themselves what they can do to benefit themselves and have an impact on others&rdquo; (pp. 50&ndash;51). </p>

<a id="p165"></a>

<p class="tx">The restorative justice movement has led to an array of efforts regarding preconviction, postconviction, and offender reentry endeavors, for both adults and for juveniles. Marquette University Law School&rsquo;s Restorative Justice Initiative (RJI) is an example of an initiative that pursued a variety of efforts, from prevention endeavors with schoolchildren to reentry efforts with adults (see the <em>Applying Criminal Justice: Marquette University Law School&rsquo;s Restorative </em><em>Justice Initiative: Range of Elements</em>). The RJI&rsquo;s efforts reflect restorative principles in that they aimed to empower victims, employed mediation, and encouraged offenders to take responsibility for their crimes; many met face-to-face with their victims, to create conditions under which the harm caused could begin to be repaired.</p>


<div class="box-2">
<h1 class="h1"><strong>Applying Criminal Justice:</strong> <em>Marquette University Law School&rsquo;s Restorative Justice Initiative: Range of Elements</em></h1>

<p class="tx">Marquette University Law School&rsquo;s Restorative Justice Initiative partnered with many organizations and programs in the surrounding community. These included:</p>

<ol class="bl">
<li class="bl">Milwaukee Safe Streets Initiative: On July 2007, after The Marquette Law School Restorative Justice Initiative received $384,290 for an &ldquo;Anti-Gang Pilot Site Program&rdquo; as part of a federal government grant awarded to The Milwaukee Safe Street Initiative, Ron Johnson and Paulina de Haan were hired as community coordinators to work in the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) 5th and 2nd District neighborhoods, respectively. Ron and Paulina actively worked with the MULS Restorative Justice Initiative coordinating community gang prevention and intervention activities with law enforcement officials, prosecutors, social service agencies, faith communities, corrections officials, and neighborhood communities. On June 15, 2011, two years after the federal grant finished, the Marquette Law School Restorative Justice Initiative wrapped up its operation with the Safe Street Initiative.</li>
<li class="bl">Victim/Offender Dialogues: The RJI received crimes of severe violence cases, including homicides, through the Wisconsin Office of Victim Services and Programs. The Initiative provided <em>pro bono</em> mediation services for victims wishing to meet with the offender(s) in their case.</li>
<li class="bl">Green Bay and Columbia Maximum Security Prison Programs: These provided victims the opportunity to speak with circles of very serious offenders in Green Bay and Columbia, often bringing along law students and community members. Victims felt empowered when speaking about how crime has affected their lives, and offenders were encouraged to share how they better understand the negative impact of their crimes.</li>
<li class="bl">FOCUS Program: FOCUS is a Milwaukee County juvenile justice program working with high-end offenders. The law students provided a restorative justice component, using the circle process (run by the law students) and victim speakers to humanize the face of crime for the young men.</li>
<li class="bl">Earned Release Program: ERP is a 25-bed, strength-based, gender-responsive, AODA (Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse) program at the Milwaukee Women&rsquo;s Correctional Center. The RJI students worked with the ERP, educating the women about restorative justice and conducting circles with victim speakers that were brought in to participate.</li>
<li class="bl"><a id="p166"></a>Milwaukee Public Schools: Social workers within MPS approached the Initiative about using restorative justice to combat bullying, stealing, and other issues in certain problematic classrooms. Law students facilitated circles addressing different concerns within MPS.</li>
<li class="bl">Marquette University: The Restorative Justice Initiative has conducted talking circles on multi-student discipline issues.</li>
<li class="bl">Marquette University High School: Partnered with the Restorative Justice Initiative in the Milwaukee Metro Conference, Professor Geske and law students facilitated circles on unsportsmanlike behavior, as well as other student behavioral issues, with administrators, coaches, athletes, and student leaders of 10 Milwaukee area high schools.</li>
<li class="bl">Alma Center and the Task Force on Family Violence: In a unique partnership, the Alma Center and the Task Force came together to provide a restorative justice component to the Alma Center&rsquo;s Batterers&rsquo; Treatment Program. The Initiative&rsquo;s clinical students were asked to run the circles using surrogate victims of domestic violence, along with group and individual work.</li>
<li class="bl">Ethan Allen Juvenile Correctional Facility: The students, under the guidance of the Initiative, facilitated bi-monthly circles focusing on the impact of crime with juvenile offenders at the Boys and Girls Club that is on site.</li>
<li class="bl">St. Charles Treatment Center MPS: Students in the restorative justice clinic conducted community building circles with students at St. Charles Alternative School. The RJI Clinic students explained restorative justice and then conducted circles focusing on getting to know each other, as well as making both good and bad choices; causing harm; and how harm affects the victim, offender, and the community.</li>

<p class="tx">Many restorative justice efforts hold a lot of promise. However, it is important to consider that they may also experience pitfalls and, like all programs, can have unintended consequences.</p>



<div class="box-2">
<h1 class="h1"><strong>Applying Criminal Justice:</strong> <em>Restorative Justice: Implementation Issues</em></h1>

<p class="tx">The general aims of restorative justice are desirable. &ldquo;The restorative justice movement is grounded in values that promote both accountability and healing for all affected by crime. It emphasizes positive human development, mutuality, empathy, responsibility, respect, and fairness&rdquo; (Umbreit, Vos, &amp; Coates, 2005, p. 3). However, designing and implementing restorative justice efforts requires careful planning, with attention paid to how program elements and activities will achieve their intended results and avoid unintended consequences.</p>

<p class="tx">As Umbreit et al. (2005) point out, there are many needs to balance: &ldquo;needs of victims, needs of offenders, needs of their community, and ultimately the needs of the state that has come to represent them&rdquo; (p. 3). These authors discuss two cases in which judges with good intentions took actions that produced unintended negative results: </p>

<a id="p167"></a>

<p class="ext">Judges in two different states took the opportunity during the civil portion of trials involving negligent homicide from drunk driving to refer the offender and the family of the victim to a mediation process. On the surface, this appeared to be a positive restorative option for both. However, in each instance there was no separate preparation of the involved parties, and the persons responsible for facilitating the meetings had no specific training in victim&ndash;offender dialogue. (Umbreit et al., 2005, p. 4)</p>

<p class="tx">In both the drunk driving cases, not enough attention was paid to how program elements and activities would be implemented. The court-ordered mediation therefore caused the victims to experience &ldquo;intense fear and re-victimization&rdquo; (Umbreit et al., 2005, p. 4). The interaction&rsquo;s potential negative results had not been examined, and activities had not been carefully planned for. While restorative justice, in all its various forms, can have positive impacts, it is important to think about not just about an effort&rsquo;s concept or logic but also its implementation. How an effort is implemented, and by whom, is extremely significant. If you were leading a restorative justice effort or program, how would you ensure that the intended effects would be achieved and that unintended effects were avoided?</p>

<div class="clear-both"></div>
</div>


<p class="tx">Restorative justice as a primary aim of community corrections leads us to several questions. Consider the <em>Applying Criminal Justice: Restorative Justice: Implementation Issues</em> feature box. Can restorative justice efforts actually restore victims or the community? Furthermore, what is the actual or operational meaning of restoring victims and communities? What is to be restored, and to what level? Who should decide the extent and nature of the restoration?</p>

<p class="tx">Furthermore, restorative justice means more than simply being law-abiding or even just repairing harm; it means adopting a community&rsquo;s values and beliefs while leading a socially acceptable lifestyle. As with reintegration, we must consider what are the standards for values, beliefs, and lifestyles, and who gets to decide them? Such questions must be answered in order to define &ldquo;restorative justice&rdquo; and determine whether its programs or efforts fit under the umbrella of community corrections. </p>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec7.2">7.2&ensp;Community Corrections Programs: Preconviction Efforts</h1>

<p class="tx">There are many community corrections efforts that extend beyond probation, parole, and jail. Some are carried out in conjunction with probation, parole, or jail efforts, while others are completely separate. In this section, we examine other important community corrections efforts.</p>

<a id="p168"></a>

<p class="tx">Although we usually think of corrections as dealing with convicted offenders, community corrections may include efforts carried out during the preadjudicatory stages of the criminal justice process or as alternatives to prosecution. Most of these preconviction efforts involve diversion and pretrial release.</p>

<div class="photo-right">

<div class="p-ct">Diversion programs seek to benefit the offender and can take many forms. This young woman is a graduate of a middle school truancy diversion program.</div>
</div>

<h2 class="h2">Diversion </h2>

<p class="tx"><strong>Diversion</strong> programs are alternatives to standard arrest and prosecution processes. As defined by the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals (1973), diversion efforts are &ldquo;formally acknowledged and organized efforts to utilize alternatives to initial or continued processing into the justice system. To qualify as diversion, such efforts must be undertaken prior to adjudication and after a legally proscribed action has occurred&rdquo; (p. 73). In other words, a candidate for diversion could be or perhaps has been arrested and could be taken to trial to face criminal prosecution for the offense. However, he or she could avoid adjudication by agreeing to voluntarily enter a diversion program without being formally ordered to do so. Such programs can include &ldquo;a range of initiatives, such as intensive supervisory probation, restitution, mandatory community service, and specialized courts&rdquo; (NIJ, n.d.b).</p>

<p class="tx">In diversion, criminal justice officials can decide not to invoke a typical, formal, criminal justice process. For example, a law enforcement officer could decide not to arrest someone, instead referring him or her to a social service agency; similarly, a prosecutor could allow a defendant to avoid trial, offering the accused an opportunity to complete, say, a domestic violence counseling program, a substance abuse program, or another requirement in lieu of prosecution.</p>

<p class="tx">Criminal justice officials have long made discretionary use of diversion. When officials use discretion individually, rather than as part of an organized effort, it could be called <em>informal </em><em>diversion</em> (Camilletti, 2010). In recent years there has been growing interest in formalizing diversion; for example, by formally screening cases to determine the accused&rsquo;s suitability for diversion, developing diversion casework positions, and formalizing arrangements that link networks of community resources to diversion efforts.</p>

<a id="p169"></a>

<p class="tx">Diversion can take a number of forms, and officials are relatively free to use available resources to design diversion strategies. For example, instead of arrest, a person accused of battering his or her spouse could be asked to attend a family crisis counseling program. A person accused of public drunkenness could be asked to attend an alcohol abuse program. In lieu of prosecution, the accused could be offered the chance to attend a treatment or educational program or to participate in another effort that the prosecutor deems appropriate (Camilletti, 2010). </p>

<p class="tx">Diversion often benefits an accused person. The accused may retain his or her job, whereas confinement would likely result in its loss. He or she may also be able to avoid hiring an attorney and paying other direct costs associated with prosecution. The accused can also avoid the stigma of being labeled as a &ldquo;convict&rdquo; and the formal record that comes with this&mdash;perhaps he or she can even avoid having an arrest record. The accused may receive treatment at little or no cost or may get other forms of direct assistance to resolve problems. However, if the accused fails to complete the diversion requirements, the original penalties may be restored or even increased (NIJ, n.d.b).</p>

<p class="tx">Despite its benefits, diversion is controversial. The accused gives up the due process guarantees that accompany formal prosecution processes. It could be argued that persons who might be able to successfully argue their innocence may opt for diversion unadvisedly. Some argue that diversion &ldquo;widens the net&rdquo; of criminal justice, providing ways to unnecessarily extend social control. Others argue that efforts to expand the use of diversion may obscure the focus on victims and justice. Nonetheless, many regard diversion as a pragmatic way to deal with cases in which the accused may benefit and in which the usual, formal processing would misapply the scarce resources of an already overburdened system.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Pretrial Release</h2>

<p class="tx"><strong>Pretrial release</strong> is different from diversion in that it aims to provide an alternative to detention while the defendant awaits trial. A candidate for pretrial release does not avoid prosecution or further formal processing.</p>

<p class="tx">Pretrial release is a response to the fact that pretrial detention often poses numerous problems for defendants. The accused&rsquo;s family may have trouble getting by if the accused is detained while awaiting trial. The accused could also lose his or her job or suffer other critical losses. Additionally, jail space in general is a scarce resource, and even more of it is needed if people are to be detained pretrial. These concerns have led many to focus on pretrial release as a viable alternative to pretrial detention. </p>

<p class="tx">Pretrial release options may feature bail or no bail, require supervised release (though unsupervised release is more common), and feature conditional release or release with no conditions other than that the defendant must appear for trial. Pretrial release may take place prior to the jailing of a defendant or after the accused has been placed in detention.</p>

<p class="tx">Financial pretrial release options involve the defendant posting bail, using either cash or another financial pledge, to obtain release. Nonfinancial options involve an unsecured pledge, such as when one is released on recognizance, in which the accused&rsquo;s signature is enough to obtain release. The NIJ (2015) notes that &ldquo;[there are] other kinds of insurance that would motivate a defender not to flee, such as a defendant&rsquo;s housing situation, employment, family and other community ties&rdquo; (para 2). The majority of pretrial releases fit within the scope of these financial and nonfinancial options. </p>

<p class="tx">Since 1960 scores of jurisdictions have developed and implemented formalized pretrial release programs. These programs generally incorporate conditions for release and may involve supervised release. Such programs screen candidates to determine both their suitability for release and their needs upon being released. They also ascertain whether the candidate has problems or needs that could be addressed while on pretrial release by community resources, specific conditions, or supervision. Finally, such programs take appropriate steps to ensure the defendant appears in court. Some programs include a pretrial work release component&mdash;that is, if the defendant is employed, he or she will be allowed to work outside the jail during work hours and return to confinement during nonwork hours.</p>

<a id="p170"></a>

<p class="tx">According to Cohen (2012), from 2008 to 2010, 36% of felony defendants in federal district courts were released prior to case adjudication. Defendants brought in on immigration violations had the lowest release rate (12%), followed by those brought in on violent offenses (30%). Defendants accused of property offenses had the highest rate of pretrial release (71%). Of the 36% who obtained pretrial release during this time, 73% were released on a nonfinancial basis, including personal recognizance or unsecured bond. Approximately 79% received conditional release in which they agreed to comply with specific conditions, such as travel and weapons restrictions or substance abuse treatment (Cohen, 2012).</p>

<p class="tx">Like diversion, pretrial release can be controversial. It raises legal issues concerning whether it is constitutional to impose certain conditions on individuals who have not been convicted of a crime (such as limiting their involvement with particular groups or individuals). Similarly, some argue about whether it is appropriate to impose supervision on people who have not yet been convicted, because of both constitutional issues and the net-widening effects of doing so. However, those in favor of supervision point to the need to mitigate instances of pretrial misconduct. Cohen&rsquo;s (2012) findings show that, for cases disposed in federal courts, &ldquo;nineteen percent of the defendants released pretrial committed some form of pretrial misconduct&rdquo; (p. 1). Cohen (2012) also found that &ldquo;technical violations were committed by 17% of defendants released prior to case disposition, while 1% of released defendants failed to make court appearances and 4% were rearrested for new offenses&rdquo; (p. 1). A technical violation in a supervised setting is understood to be a violation of a general or specific condition (such as failing to meet a pretrial condition like passing a drug test). We will further discuss these violations in Chapter 8. Ultimately, expanding pretrial release options is regarded as a pragmatic way to assist certain individuals and make the most out of the scarce resources available in the nation&rsquo;s jails.</p>

<h1 class="h1" id="sec7.3">7.3&ensp;Community Corrections Programs: Postconviction Efforts</h1>

<p class="tx">In addition to probation, parole, and jail, postconviction efforts include a well-recognized set of community-based endeavors, which include restitution and community service programs, temporary release programs (work release, study release, furloughs), various residential programs, and an array of nonresidential programs. </p>

<p class="tx">Beyond these, communities can deal with offenders by establishing &ldquo;third-level&rdquo; alternatives. Since the 1980s, third-level alternatives have been characterized as &ldquo;tough&rdquo; and &ldquo;punitive,&rdquo; and do not compromise public safety (Petersilia, 1988). Core third-level programs typically involve intensive supervision, such as assigning risky probationers or people on parole/extended supervision to a maximum supervision caseload (which involves small numbers of offenders who are supervised by a team of agents), house arrest (also called home confinement), electronic monitoring, drug courts, and boot camps.</p>

<a id="p171"></a>

<h2 class="h2">Restitution and Community Service</h2>

<p class="tx"><strong>Restitution</strong> involves requiring offenders to repay the community for their crimes, either with money, through work, or by providing a service. <strong>Community service</strong> is work, as ordered by the court, that offenders perform as payment for their crimes. Both restitution and community service are usually imposed in conjunction with probation, as special conditions. These could also be required as conditions of a diversion program.</p>

<p class="tx">Restitution and community service have become widely used sentencing options, and most jurisdictions have correctional programs that feature them. For example, in 2017 the Florida Department of Corrections (2017) reported that &ldquo;the statewide rate for offenders successfully completing probation was 59.7%&rdquo; (p. 52) and that offenders &ldquo;performed more than 1.1 million hours of public service work for the community&rdquo; (p. 45). </p>

<p class="tx">The primary issues surrounding restitution involve the offender&rsquo;s ability to make payments, the potential nature of the offender&ndash;victim relationship during the restitution period (whether the offender will directly pay the victim or, as in many jurisdictions, make payments through a probation or other intermediary agency), and how to enforce payment. To this end, the court may provide an inducement, such as suspending the sentence or threatening the offender with imminent incarceration. In some jurisdictions, the court may refer the offender to an intermediary agency that will help him or her find a job, will ensure payment is made on a certain schedule, and can return the offender to court for failing to pay. Primary issues regarding community service involve determining how much of what type of service is appropriate vis-&agrave;-vis the offense, as well as determining an offenders&rsquo; eligibility to participate in a community service program.</p>

<p class="tx">Restitution and community service programs have not been shown to reduce recidivism. However, because of the economics and the logic involved in such efforts, and because of the need to provide sanctions for large numbers of offenders convicted of less serious offenses, these options are well ensconced in community corrections.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Temporary Release Programs</h2>

<p class="tx"><strong>Work release</strong>programs are those that allow prison or jail inmates to work in a community setting. The inmates reside in their designated facility, go to work in the community for a specified period of the day, and then return to their place of incarceration. According to the Washington State Department of Corrections (2015), &ldquo;work release . . . facilities serve as a bridge between life in prison and life in the community&rdquo; (p. 1). <strong>Study release</strong> allows inmates to go into the community to participate in an academic or vocational program. </p>

<p class="tx">Both work release and study release aim to prepare incarcerated offenders to live a more law-abiding lifestyle upon serving their sentence. Work release may have economic benefits for the inmate and his or her family. The working inmate pays taxes, and many programs require him or her to pay a fee to cover room and board expenses, thereby defraying costs of incarceration. Study release may assist in personal development, which may in turn help the inmate find employment or access other beneficial opportunities. Both strategies involve crucial issues regarding inmate eligibility and selection. Program space is typically limited, and preference is given to the most deserving inmates&mdash;those most likely to successfully complete them, those least likely to cause problems while enrolled, and so on. Both strategies depend on what resources are available in a given locale and on the inclinations and efforts of corrections personnel in developing networks of resources. Work release is particularly dependent on the inclinations and needs of employers, as well as on inmates&rsquo; marketable abilities and skills. Study release programs are dependent on an area&rsquo;s available educational and vocational resources and on inmates&rsquo; baseline preparations (i.e., whether inmates have attained a level of education that will allow them to meaningfully participate in certain programs).</p>

<a id="p172"></a>

<p class="tx"><strong>Furloughs</strong> allow inmates to leave their detention facility and go into the community for a short period, usually for a few days. The inmate is not directly supervised during the furlough, so not all types of inmates are eligible for furloughs. According to the Florida Department of Correction&rsquo;s (2016) <em>Inmate Orientation Handbook</em>, &ldquo;Inmates classified as Minimum or Community custody, and who meet additional required criteria, are eligible for consideration for furlough upon approval of the Warden&rdquo; (p. 7). Furloughs can serve several purposes. An inmate could search for employment or a place to live in advance of being released. He or she could connect with support groups, family members, or other helpful entities. Prison administrators might grant furloughs for other reasons, too. For example, &ldquo;a furlough may be granted for an inmate to visit a dying relative, attend the funeral of a relative, or for other compelling reasons consistent with public interest&rdquo; (Florida Department of Corrections, 2016, p. 7). </p>

<p class="tx">Keep in mind that almost all incarcerated Americans will one day be released to the community. During the past 2 decades, tens of thousands of furloughs have been quietly granted across the United States. Although some express concern over whether those on furlough might commit other crimes or abscond, such violations are relatively rare.</p>

<p class="tx">Temporary release programs have not been shown to significantly affect recidivism. Nonetheless, because of their logical appeal and pragmatic aims, they remain a staple on the community corrections menu.</p>


<h2 class="h2">Residential Programs/Halfway Houses</h2>

<div class="video-right">
<p class="video-head">Rules at Facility</p>
<div class="video-caption">Halfway house residents have to follow strict rules. Residents are required to take behavior modification classes and need permission to leave the facility.

</div>

<p class="tx"><strong>Halfway houses</strong> are residential facilities that provide more structure and supervision than other community corrections endeavors. Offenders who are placed in such facilities may also be placed on probation (halfway in) or be eligible for parole or other early release (halfway out). The Commonwealth of Kentucky Department of Corrections (2017) reports that 617 of approximately 640 of their average daily population of parolees/probationers were participating in a halfway house program. These types of facilities usually have curfews and provide stricter supervision than one gets when on general probation or parole. Because residential programs have a wide variety of program elements, it is difficult to generalize about these types of facilities. Some require residents to hold a job or be looking for work; participate in group or individual counseling; attend educational, vocational, or substance abuse programs; or fulfill other requirements. </p>

<a id="p173"></a>

<p class="tx">The greatest difficulty facing residential programs is neighborhood acceptance. Most residential programs are relegated to the least desirable sites because of property owners&rsquo; resistance to them; high-income or more desirable neighborhoods typically oppose proposals to locate residential programs nearby. Residential programs are widespread, however, and have much to offer. However, as with many community corrections endeavors, there is little conclusive research on their effects.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Third-Level Alternatives (Intermediate Sanctions)</h2>

<p class="tx">An intermediate level of criminal sanctions was created in response to the large number of offenders under correctional authority, packed prisons and jails, and political interest in public protection, as well as punitive rather than &ldquo;treatment-oriented&rdquo; sanctions. These intermediate, or &ldquo;third-level,&rdquo; options fall somewhere between incarceration and community corrections. Intermediate sanctions may take a number of forms and have many variations. The following sections examine the most common intermediate sanctions: house arrest, electronic monitoring, drug courts, and boot camps. </p>

<h3 class="h3">House Arrest</h3>

<p class="tx"><strong>House arrest</strong> is a sentence imposed by the court under which an offender must stay confined in his or her own residence. Offenders under house arrest may be required to pay restitution, pay a fee (usually monthly) to defray the costs of supervision, or submit to electronic surveillance or monitoring, among other possibilities. </p>

<p class="tx">Petersilia (1988) lists the following advantages of house arrest:</p>

<ol class="bl">
<li class="bl">The financial appeal of house arrest is great because the potential savings on the yearly cost of incarcerating an offender is considerable.</li>
<li class="bl">There are social benefits because offenders who had jobs can keep them, the stigmatizing effects of incarceration are avoided, and psychological and physical disruption of family relationships can be avoided.</li>
<li class="bl"><a id="p174"></a>House arrest is flexible enough to allow response to local and offender needs because it can become a pre-conviction option in connection with diversion or pretrial release and can be molded to deal appropriately with individual offender needs.</li>
<li class="bl">There is also ease of implementation and timeliness due to pressure to reduce prison and jail overcrowding and the fact that house arrest options may require few new facilities, especially if electronic monitoring is not used. (p. 2)</li>
</ol>


<p class="tx">However, Petersilia (1988) indicates that there are also several disadvantages:</p>

<ol class="bl">
<li class="bl">House arrest may have net-widening effects that provide a set of options that could result in expansion of the population under correctional authority rather than reduction.</li>
<li class="bl">If house arrest does widen the net, costs will obviously increase for corrections rather than decrease. </li>
<li class="bl">House arrest may not be satisfactory to some as a punishment. For example, the MADD organization &ldquo;sees such sentencing as a step backward for efforts to stiffen penalties [for drunk drivers].&rdquo;</li>
<li class="bl">House arrest focuses primarily on offender surveillance rather than assistance.</li>
<li class="bl">House arrest is intrusive and possibly illegal, involving the state&rsquo;s presence in 
individuals&rsquo; homes.</li>
<li class="bl">House arrest may involve race and class bias. So far, those who have been eligible have tended disproportionately to be white collar offenders, programs involve payment of fees, and the offender must have a home and a telephone, all of which mediate against those living in poverty.</li>
<li class="bl">House arrest does not necessarily insure public safety or protection. (pp.&nbsp;2&ndash;3)</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h3 class="h3">Electronic Monitoring</h3>

<p class="tx">House arrest is often coupled with electronic monitoring to detect any violations of the sentence. <strong>Electronic monitoring</strong> refers to the use of surveillance mechanisms to monitor the location and movement of people within the criminal justice system (Nellis &amp; Lehner, 2012). Tracking devices typically use Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio frequency (RF) technology. The distinction between the two lies in what they measure: GPS systems offer continuous, real-time tracking of an offender, while RF devices monitor whether an offender is present at a specific location (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2016). The Pew Charitable Trusts (2016) reports that</p>

<p class="ext">the number of accused and convicted criminal offenders in the United States who are monitored with ankle bracelets and other electronic tracking devices rose nearly 140 percent over 10 years. . . . More than 125,000 people were supervised with the devices in 2015, up from 53,000 in 2005. (para 1)</p>

<p class="tx">Electronic monitoring can help correction departments &ldquo;to track offenders, to increase compliance with the terms of offenders&rsquo; release into the community, and to thereby reduce recidivism&rdquo; (NIJ, 2012b). The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) uses RF as part of its Division of Adult Parole Operations Electronic In-Home Detention (EID) program. The CDCR (2017) states that the &ldquo;the EID program is used to monitor offender compliance with imposed curfews as an enhancement to supervision and an alternative sanction to incarceration.&rdquo; Similarly, the Michigan Department of Corrections initiated a successful Curfew Monitoring (previously known as Radio Frequency) program in 1986. &ldquo;By the end of 1987, it was being used on a statewide basis. It allows for the monitoring and enforcement of curfews and other conditions of community supervision&rdquo; (Michigan Department of Corrections, 2018, para 1). </p>

<a id="p175"></a>

<p class="tx">Electronic monitoring in itself (not in conjunction with house arrest) may be used as a front-door strategy&mdash;that is, in sentencing decisions&mdash;or as a back-door strategy&mdash;that is, in decisions concerning early release from prison. Electronic monitoring is also used as a supervision strategy in some pretrial release decisions, affording a higher degree of surveillance. Electronic monitoring is a relatively recent correctional tool, but its use has rapidly increased and continues to develop as technology improves. </p>

<p class="tx">Reported success with electronic monitoring, along with technological advances, have grown its use. For example, the state of Florida uses electronic monitoring, as appropriate, as a feature of the following supervision elements: probation, drug offender probation, sex offender probation, community control, conditional release, parole, and addiction supervision release (Bales et al., 2010).  </p>

<p class="tx">Another reason for widespread use of electronic monitoring is its effectiveness in cutting costs, as we discuss in the feature box <em>Applying Criminal Justice: &ldquo;Saving Money&rdquo; as a Rationale for Electronic Monitoring and Other Community Corrections Efforts</em>.</p>



<div class="box-2">
<h1 class="h1"><strong>Applying Criminal Justice:</strong> <em>&ldquo;Saving Money&rdquo; as a Rationale for Electronic Monitoring and Other Community Corrections Efforts</em></h1>

<div class="photo-box-left">
<img id="img7.6" class="scaled" alt="A parolee wearing an electronic monitoring device on his ankle." title="A parolee wearing an electronic monitoring device on his ankle." src="images/7.6.jpg" />
<p class="credit">Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press</p>
</div>

<p class="tx">Electronic monitoring was first used in corrections in the 1980s and became more widespread throughout the 1990s as the technology became more promising. Electronic monitoring allows authorities to more closely supervise an offender than if he or she were on ordinary probation, and it is less restrictive than incarceration. Many politicians and correctional officials think electronic monitoring has an important role to play in pursuit of the greater goal of protecting society.</p>

<p class="tx">Many have argued that electronic monitoring (in addition to other community corrections ventures) saves money when one compares the average daily cost of electronic monitoring to the average daily cost of incarcerating someone in prison or jail. Gilna and Zoukis (2017) report that </p>

<p class="ext">in La Crosse County, Wisconsin, for example, GPS monitors cost $800 each to purchase and $6 each per month to monitor&mdash;versus a jail bed which can cost tens of thousands of dollars to build and up to $83 a day to maintain. </p>

<a id="p176"></a>

<p class="tx">However, the matter is more complex. While electronic monitoring indeed offers many benefits&mdash;including the ability to more closely surveil risky persons and avoid the need for more jail cells&mdash;the only way to &ldquo;save money&rdquo; with electronic monitoring (or any other community alternative) is to keep vacant the cell that that person would have occupied. If someone is placed on electronic monitoring but the jail cell he or she would have occupied is now filled with a different offender, then another person has been <em>added</em> to the correctional facility&rsquo;s responsibility (&ldquo;widening the correctional net&rdquo;); a cost is still incurred for the person occupying the cell. From this perspective, electronic monitoring may achieve other desirable objectives, but it does not save money. In fact, the person on electronic monitoring can be regarded as an added cost, and thus <em>more</em> money is being spent.</p>

<p class="tx">Beyond that, if a prison has an average population of, say, 2,000 persons, and 200 cells are kept vacant by placing offenders in community corrections, the money <em>saved</em> is not so substantial. This is because the prison continues to operate, and these basic operational costs make up a large part of the average daily cost per inmate. A facility might save some money on food or staffing needs, but these costs are just a small piece of average daily costs. Because the prison must continue to operate, and because the bulk of the average daily incarceration costs stem from the prison&rsquo;s general operation, the money is still spent.</p>

<p class="tx">What is your opinion of the financial advantages of electronic monitoring and other community corrections efforts? Do you think it is fair to claim that such efforts save money? How would you respond to someone who makes that claim? What are other options?</p>

<h3 class="h3">Drug Courts: An Example of Specialized Courts</h3>

<p class="tx">Since the early 1990s more attention has been paid to the use of specialized courts, which have several distinct features. Specialized courts may feature judicial interaction (judges involved in long-term oversight of individual cases), treatment, and various correctional services, along with monitoring and supervision to target criminal offenders with special issues such as alcohol and other drug dependency, domestic violence problems, and sexual assault problems. This section focuses on drug courts. </p>

<p class="tx">The nation&rsquo;s first drug court began operation in Miami, Florida, in 1989 (King &amp; Pasquarella, 2009). As of June 2015, there were more than 3,000 drug courts in operation across the United States; approximately half were dealing with adult drug offenders, with juveniles constituting the next highest type, with approximately 409 cases (see Table 7.1). Drug courts are intended to be oriented toward treatment, rather than punishment. The possibility of avoiding traditional sanctions or punishments serves to incentivize eligible offenders to accept the drug court&rsquo;s requirements. The growing interest in drug courts stems from the realization that traditional punitive correctional approaches have done little to address drug abuse and drug-related crimes. &ldquo;In 2004, 53% of persons in state prisons were identified with a drug dependence or abuse problem, but only 15% [of those] were receiving professional treatment&rdquo; (King &amp; Pasquarella, 2009, p. 1).</p>

<p class="tx">According to the NIJ (2018b), regardless of type, drug courts are generally based on a comprehensive model that involves: </p>

<ol class="bl">
<li class="bl">Offender screening and assessment of risks, needs, and responsivity.</li>
<li class="bl">Judicial interaction.</li>
<li class="bl">Monitoring (e.g., drug testing) and supervision.</li>
<li class="bl">Graduated sanctions and incentives.</li>
<li class="bl">Treatment and rehabilitation services. (para 3)</li>
</ol>

<p class="tx">Drug courts may be part of preadjudication efforts or postconviction efforts. If preadjudication, the offender agrees to enter the drug court program in exchange for deferred prosecution and can usually avoid having to plead guilty. If the offender fails to complete the drug court&rsquo;s requirements, he or she will face prosecution. When used as a postconviction effort, offenders are typically convicted and given a traditional sentence, but this sentence is suspended on the condition that the offender complete the requirements of the drug court. If the offender fails to do so, the sentence will be unsuspended, and the offender will have to serve it as it was originally imposed.</p>

<p class="tx">According to the National Criminal Justice Reference Service&rsquo;s (2012) summary of Bureau of Justice Assistance, National Institute of Justice, and Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention web resources:</p>

<ol class="bl">
<li class="bl">Adult drug courts employ a program designed to reduce drug use relapse and criminal recidivism among defendants and offenders through risk and needs assessment, judicial interaction, monitoring and supervision, graduated sanctions and incentives, treatment and various rehabilitation services.</li>
<li class="bl"><a id="p178"></a>
Juvenile drug courts apply a similar program model that is tailored to the needs of juvenile offenders. These programs provide youth and their families with counseling, education and other services to: promote immediate intervention, treatment and structure; improve level of functioning; address problems that may contribute to drug use; build skills that increase their ability to lead drug- and crime-free lives; strengthen the family&rsquo;s capacity to offer structure and guidance; and promote accountability for all involved.</li>
<li class="bl">Family drug courts emphasize treatment for parents with substance use disorders to aid in the reunification and stabilization of families affected by parental drug use. These programs apply the adult drug court model to cases entering the child welfare system that include allegations of child abuse or neglect in which substance abuse is identified as a contributing factor. (para. 2)</li>
</ol>


<p class="tx">Adult drug courts vary in their approaches to treatment and in the services and resources they utilize. However, they all have eligibility requirements (such as an offender may not have any violent or weapons offenses, must not demonstrate any dependency on drugs or alcohol, and so on), conduct offender assessments (to determine one&rsquo;s extent of alcohol and/or drug dependency or any other problems), involve the judge in overseeing individual cases, and require the offender to enter and complete treatment (often in very rigorous treatment programs that last up to 18 months or more). The drug court offers offenders treatment and other services, and offenders remain in the community instead of being incarcerated or being subject to other traditional sanctions.</p>

<p class="tx">Evaluations of drug court programs have found they can reduce recidivism and offer cost savings, which are cited as reasons to continue and expand these efforts (see NIJ, 2012b). Truitt et al. (2003) found that, within a 2-year follow-up period, participation in drug courts in both Escambia and Jackson Counties in Florida reduced new felony recidivism rates from 40% to 12% and from 50% to 35%, respectively. Driscoll (2018) further notes that &ldquo;drug courts are among the few proven tools to reduce addiction-based recidivism&rdquo; (p. 1412). A study by Finigan, Carey, and Cox (2007) found that investment costs per drug court participant were on average $1,392 lower than investment costs per non&ndash;drug court participant.</p>

<p class="tx"> In general, there is a conventional wisdom that drug courts &ldquo;work&rdquo; (Goldcamp, 2010). However, Goldcamp (2010) urges caution, arguing that we are not yet clear on <em>what</em> exactly works across programs. As with many correctional and treatment efforts, there is much variation in how programs are implemented. Furthermore, King and Pasquarella (2009) suggest that some studies about drug courts&rsquo; efficacy should be interpreted with caution, since some have several methodological issues. For example, some studies have difficulties in defining drug court variables; others have differing compositions of drug court participants (heavy, long-term users versus low-level, short-term users); still others vary in their definition of recidivism, examination of available services, and more.</p>

<p class="tx">The NIJ (2018c, para. 6) notes that several factors may affect a drug court&rsquo;s success:</p>

<ol class="bl">
<li class="bl">Proper assessment and treatment.</li>
<li class="bl">The role assumed by the judge and the nature of offender interactions with the&nbsp;judge.</li>
<li class="bl">Other variable influences such as drug use trends, staff turnover and resource 
allocation. (para. 6)</li>
</ol>

<p class="tx">Drug courts appear to be very promising for some offenders in terms of addressing their crimes and dependencies. It must be kept in mind, however, that what constitutes a &ldquo;drug court&rdquo; may vary based on several factors, and thus a court should be assessed its own successes and failures, each evaluated on its ability to be successful with the offenders brought before them. Indeed, this logic applies to all types of specialized courts and intermediate sanctions.</p>

<div class="p-ct">One criticism of correctional boot camps is that they emphasize vigorous activity as their primary means of correctional reform. What else might they do to support reform?</div>
</div>

<h3 class="h3">Boot Camps</h3>

<p class="tx">Correctional boot camps are designed to resemble military basic training. According to the NIJ (2003):</p>

<p class="ext">They emphasize vigorous physical activity, drill and ceremony, manual labor, and other activities that ensure the participants have little, if any, free time. Strict rules govern all aspects of conduct and appearance. Correctional officers acts as drill instructors, initially using intense verbal tactics designed to break down [participants&rsquo;] resistance and lead to constructive changes. (p. 2)</p>

<p class="tx">Boot camps may also punish misbehavior with push-ups or hard labor (Wilson, MacKenzie, &amp; Mitchell, 2003/2008). As with drug courts, the implementation of the boot camp concept can significantly vary. Wilson et al. (2003/2008) note that </p>

<p class="ext">boot camps differ substantially in the amount of focus given to the physical training and hard labor aspects of the program versus therapeutic programming [that they may or may not include] such as academic education, drug treatment, or cognitive skills. (p. 2) </p>

<p class="tx">Correctional boot camps arose in the United States in 1983. Their use expanded throughout the 1980s and early 1990s and declined into the 2000s (NIJ, 2003; Wilson et al., 2003/2008). The central idea of boot camps is that military-style discipline would correct those who had committed offenses. This thinking had popular appeal, and initial claims of success led to proliferation of these efforts. As research on boot camps became more plentiful and sophisticated, however, the claims of success became fewer as research began to refute them. Wilson et al.&rsquo;s (2003/2008) meta-analysis of 32 research studies assessed the effects of 43 boot camp programs. They concluded that although some studies showed that boot camp participants had lower recidivism rates than comparison groups, &ldquo;all of these studies had the common element of a militaristic boot camp program for offenders. The current evidence suggests that this common and defining feature of a boot camp is not effective in reducing post boot camp offending&rdquo; (Wilson et al., 2003/2008, p. 3).</p>

<h1 class="eoc-h1" id="ch07Conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>

<p class="tx">Community corrections encompasses many approaches and practices. Probation and parole are the largest and most identifiable elements of community corrections. However, diversion, pretrial release, restitution programs, community service programs, work release, study release, furloughs, and a variety of residential programs also fit beneath the community corrections umbrella. Recently, third-level alternatives such as house arrest, electronic monitoring programs, certain specialized court programs (such as drug courts), and boot camps have attracted attention as corrections endeavors that can offer more control over offenders and improve their correction in the community.</p>

<p class="tx">Reintegration and restorative justice are key concepts underlying the notion of community corrections. <em>Reintegration</em>, <em>restorative justice</em>, and <em>community corrections</em> can be elusive terms. We must consider what <em>community</em> means while deciding what truly constitutes reintegration and/or restorative justice. In practice, convicted offenders and those who have not yet been convicted exist in diverse community settings, each of which uses different community corrections programs. In the past some have considered community corrections a panacea for corrections. Now the tenor of discussion and expectation appears to have changed.</p>
