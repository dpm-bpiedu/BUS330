<h1 class="h1" id="ch02intro">Introduction</h1>



<p class="tx">Today&rsquo;s business is a humanity-centric endeavor that contributes to sustaining and improving the world and invites customers into collaboration to create the value they seek. What is the role of the marketing department in this new paradigm? </p>

<p class="tx">In this chapter we&rsquo;ll put marketing in context of the business processes that support the execution of a company&rsquo;s strategic plans. Then we will narrow our focus to the marketing process&mdash;the series of logical steps carried out by corporate marketing departments and others in an organization, based on sound business planning. Sequential steps of analysis, marketing strategy, campaign development, execution, and measurement make up the marketing process. Throughout upcoming chapters, you&rsquo;ll build on these fundamental process concepts to gain a deeper understanding of what marketing involves. In Chapter 9 we&rsquo;ll return to this marketing process, with a focus on how it is managed to achieve integration across the dozens (even hundreds) of functional units that contribute to marketing, inside and outside a company.</p>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec2.1">2.1&ensp;Putting Marketing in Context</h1>

<p class="tx"><strong>Macro marketing</strong> is the largest framework relevant to our discussion&mdash;the effect that companies&rsquo; marketing activities, institutions, and processes have on the world at large. Macro marketing concerns the social process that directs the flow of an economy&rsquo;s goods and services from producer to consumer, with a goal of meeting demand with supply and accomplishing the objectives of that social system. In other words, macro marketing concerns the system that determines what and how much is to be produced; how it is distributed; and who produces it, for whom, and by when (Perreault, Cannon, &amp; McCarthy, 2015).</p>

<p class="tx">Here the role of <strong>corporate social responsibility (CSR)</strong> comes into play. Where is that flow humanity-centric&mdash;that is, beneficial to society, or at least harm-free, in terms of its resource consumption, human impact, and environmental (ecological) effects? We cannot and should not ignore macro marketing, because in the interconnected world of our market-driven system, broad populations have a stake in the outcomes of choices that companies and consumers make (Perreault et al., 2015). The macro marketing frame requires marketing managers to do their best to select strategies and processes that improve positive effects and reduce negative effects on people and the planet.</p>

<p class="tx">Within that macro frame, individual companies operate. Marketing decision makers undertake activities designed to sense customer needs and wants, then choose strategies that satisfy them. This <strong>micro marketing</strong> frame is the focus of this course&mdash;how individuals in organizations decide the strategies and conduct the processes of the marketing function. </p>

<p class="tx">The marketing function is just one component of business activity. Additional functions include accounting, human resources, and information technology, among others. Within each department, groups of specialists create value for the organization.</p>

<a id="p33"></a>
<p class="tx">By their very nature most departments are focused inward, creating value (for instance, producing quarterly financial statements or installing new computers) without contact with customers or competitors. Marketing departments, on the other hand, naturally focus outward and thus play a key role in keeping the organization alert to its customers, competitors, and other actors and forces in the marketing environment. (The marketing environment is the topic of Chapter 8.)</p>

<p class="tx">All that activity requires coordination, so businesses have managers. <strong>Business management</strong> involves planning, organizing, leading, controlling, and monitoring activity. These functions take place within each department, coordinated by the organization&rsquo;s overall strategic direction. Each department occupies a specific place on the organizational chart and operates under the oversight of a manager. Companies vary in the number of layers of management between frontline contributors and the senior leaders who set strategy and are responsible to shareholders for financial performance.</p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.1.1">Strategic Planning</h2>
<p class="tx">Where does this company-wide strategic plan that sets direction for every department come from? What process generates it? <strong>Strategic planning</strong> is itself a business process not unlike the marketing process. But the strategic planning process drives all other business processes. In strategic planning, an organization selects an overall direction.</p>

<p class="tx">The strategic planning process calls for top-level executives and other <strong>stakeholders</strong> in a business (such as customers, board members, employees, creditors, and suppliers) to examine its current status and relevant trends to decide on a <strong>mission</strong> and <strong>vision</strong> that reflect the purpose it envisions for itself in society&mdash;producing profits, performing a charitable function, meeting the needs of members or owners, or serving some other goal. Every organization, no matter its function, exists because of its founders&rsquo; authentic commitment to a purpose. With that purpose as its &ldquo;North Star&rdquo; to steer toward, planners set long-term objectives, devise strategies and tactics to achieve those objectives, and summarize all those decisions in a strategic plan document. </p>

<p class="tx">The company-wide strategic plan defines the role and goal for every department, which must be translated into departmental objectives. Strategies developed within each department will support these overarching goals. Each department&rsquo;s manager takes direction from a component of the plan that specifies the objectives for which he or she is responsible and accountable. </p>

<p class="tx">The company&rsquo;s strategic plan determines how it will deploy resources in each of its functions, from innovation and marketing to operations, human resources, and finances. Most large firms carry out a formalized, top-down strategic planning process on a regular cycle, usually every year. Many other companies, including those in start-up mode and businesses going through transitions such as a merger or change of leadership, also do formal strategic planning.</p>

<a id="p34"></a>
<p class="tx">Can you visualize yourself in a seat in a marketing department within a company, your day-to-day experience affected by its organizational culture, your to-do list dictated by execution of its departmental strategy? Your seat could be in a company as small as the first Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s scoop shop in a renovated gas station in South Burlington, Vermont, or in a multinational like Unilever, which today owns the Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s brand. Regardless of the size of the organization around you, corporate strategy defines your experience in the micro marketing frame and functions within the macro marketing frame.</p>

<p class="tx">The marketing department is in a unique position in relation to strategic planning, because it alone is equally knowledgeable about consumers&rsquo; behavior and needs and the strengths and weaknesses of the company itself. In some organizations, the marketing department will have the power to set strategy for other departments. In all organizations, marketers stand at the gateway between consumer and producer, helping each understand the other&rsquo;s needs and wants. The marketing process is the means by which the marketing department drives the whole organization to encourage buying exchanges.</p>

<p class="tx">Strategic planning guides designing the business portfolio and selecting a growth strategy, our next topics.</p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.1.2">Designing the Business Portfolio</h2>
<p class="tx">Most companies are made up of a collection of goods and/or service lines. Each line may be at a different stage in its product life cycle; each may be facing different forces in the marketing environment. Taken together, these lines make up the <strong>business portfolio</strong> of the organization. Within the business portfolio are <strong>strategic business units (SBUs)</strong>, each of which will be treated as a separate investment, responsible for returning profit to the company. The multinational company Unilever, for example, has an SBU that consists of several frozen treat product lines aimed at different market niches, including Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s, Breyers, and Good Humor, among others. </p>

<p class="tx">Depending on a company&rsquo;s internal organization, an SBU can consist of a single product, a product line or brand, or even an autonomous company owned by the parent organization. Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s is an interesting hybrid in that its economic mission is controlled by Unilever but its product quality and social mission are controlled by the independent board of Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s (Edmondson, 2014). </p>

<p class="tx">If a company is sufficiently complex, it may organize itself around product groups (associated items that consumers might use together, or think of as similar) within the business portfolio. Unilever, for example, is organized into three separate units that control its product groups for food and drink, home care, and personal care products. Within its food and drink unit are separate subunits organized to provide all the functions required to produce and market different product lines. Each develops its own corporate strategy but takes direction from the parent company. </p>


<a id="p35"></a>
<p class="tx">The full collection of items offered by the company is referred to as its <strong>product mix</strong>, or assortment (see Figure 2.1).</p>


<div class="figure-box">
<h4 class="figure-name">Figure 2.1: Relationships among a company&rsquo;s offerings</h4>
<h5 class="figure-title">The product assortment is made up of product lines, to which individual items are assigned.</h5>

<img src="figures/fig_2.1.jpg" alt="Diagram of relationships among a company&rsquo;s offerings." title="Diagram of relationships among a company&rsquo;s offerings." class="figure" id="fig_2.1" />
</div>

<p class="tx">No matter the size or organizational structure of a firm, business portfolio planning requires first analyzing the current portfolio to determine how much support each SBU deserves. Then planners must decide what the future portfolio should be.</p>

<p class="tx">The ideal business portfolio reflects the company&rsquo;s strengths and leverages opportunities in the marketing environment. To achieve healthy cash flow over both the short and long term, a company&rsquo;s portfolio should have some products that are growing faster than others and some that have a greater <strong>market share</strong> than others.</p>

<p class="tx">A widely taught method for analysis of the business portfolio is the <strong>BCG Matrix</strong>, originally developed by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in the 1960s (Boston Consulting Group, 2011). This growth/share matrix (shown in Figure 2.2) assigns SBUs to one of four quadrants based on the amount of cash each generates or requires. The BCG Matrix is also known as the BCG growth/share matrix or, simply, the Boston Box. In the BCG Matrix, each SBU is represented by a circle that differs in size by sales volume.</p>


<a id="p36"></a>
<div class="figure-box">
<h4 class="figure-name">Figure 2.2: Hypothetical BCG Matrix</h4>
<h5 class="figure-title">The BCG Matrix assesses market growth rate and relative market share for strategic business units by visualizing the relative market share of products and the growth of their market. The BCG Matrix shown represents hypothetical drug brands.</h5>
<img src="figures/fig_2.2.jpg" alt="Diagram of the BCG Matrix. Relative market share axis crosses the market growth axis horizontally." title="Diagram of the BCG Matrix. Relative market share axis crosses the market growth axis horizontally." class="figure" id="fig_2.2" />
<p class="credit_left"><strong><em>Adapted from The BCG Portfolio Matrix from the Product Portfolio Matrix, &copy; 1970, The Boston Consulting Group. Reprinted by permission </em><em>of the Boston Consulting Group.</em></strong></p>
</div>


<p class="tx">The quadrants are defined as:</p>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl"><em>Stars:</em> High-growth, high-share SBUs that generate cash flow but also require significant investment to finance their growth.</li>
<li class="bl"><em>Cash cows:</em> Low-growth, high-share SBUs that produce cash flow while requiring little investment to hold their market share.</li>
<li class="bl"><em>Question marks:</em> High-growth but low-share SBUs that require investment to hold their place; increasing their share will require even more cash&mdash;a gamble.</li>
<li class="bl"><em>Dogs:</em> Low-growth, low-share SBUs that generate enough cash flow to be self-sustaining but show little promise of moving toward higher share or growth rate.</li>
</ul>

<p class="tx">Cash cows provide the cash flow that covers a company&rsquo;s overhead and allows it to invest resources in other SBUs. Stars, dogs, and question marks require investment before they will provide cash&mdash;if they ever will. But without some stars and question marks in development, the company will have nothing to replace a cash cow when it reaches the end of its product life cycle.</p>

<p class="tx">Once strategic planners have assigned their SBUs to quadrants in the BCG Matrix, they must forecast what role each will play going forward. Depending on the SBU&rsquo;s role, planners choose a strategy: build up the SBU with an investment of resources, hold steady, harvest short-term profits while planning for divestment, or phase it out completely. The tools of portfolio analysis, such as the BCG Matrix, are equally applicable to product strategy.</p>


<a id="p37"></a>
<p class="tx">The connection between the BCG Matrix and marketing strategy should thus be clear: Stars and cash cows are likely to receive more marketing support than question marks and dogs. </p>

<p class="tx">The BCG Matrix is useful to select strategies that balance exploitation of mature SBUs while exploring the new opportunities that will fuel future growth. There are, however, problems with the BCG Matrix:</p>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">It can be difficult to adequately define SBUs in terms of their market share and growth in order to assign them to the appropriate quadrants. Unless planners also predict a direction of movement for each SBU, the matrix provides little insight into the future. Product life cycles and the effect of diffusion of innovation (subjects that will be discussed in Chapter 3) must be taken into account. </li>
<li class="bl">A product&rsquo;s future does not unfold in a vacuum. Planners would be well advised to consider competitors&rsquo; SBUs&mdash;but gathering the needed information about competitors can be difficult.</li>
<li class="bl">The matrix implies that relative market-share growth and increased growth rate are the most important strategic goals, while failing to hint at the difficulty of achieving those goals. Businesses can easily be drawn into new areas they do not know how to manage. </li>
<li class="bl">Circumstances change more swiftly and unpredictably than in the past. SBUs move within and across the quadrants more rapidly. Companies must be capable of agile response, which means reconsidering the BCG Matrix more frequently.</li>
<li class="bl">The matrix takes into account only the traditional measures of performance that impact profits: market growth and relative market share. In a humanity-centric marketplace, other measures may be just as relevant. </li>
</ul>

<p class="tx">To avoid problems, marketing planning teams should include managers who have frequent contact with customers and suppliers. Strategic experiments should be developed that allow adaptation before rolling out fully developed strategies. Planners should blend insights from the BCG Matrix with other, more detailed planning based on their specific situations and should bear in mind the triple bottom line&mdash;that impact of strategy decisions on people and the planet, as well as profits.</p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.1.3">Selecting a Growth Strategy</h2>
<p class="tx">While all departments in an organization contribute to creating value for customers, marketers hold the responsibility for achieving profitable growth for the company. Only the marketing department can identify, assess, and select which market opportunities to pursue and&nbsp;how.</p>

<p class="tx">A tool that helps marketers identify growth strategies is Ansoff&rsquo;s Matrix, shown in Table 2.1. Like the BCG Matrix, this matrix aids planners in developing alternatives from which to choose a strategy. Ansoff&rsquo;s Matrix assesses the potential for increasing sales via four market&ndash;product strategies:</p>

<a id="p38"></a>
<ol class="nl">
<li class="nl">	<em>Market penetration:</em> A strategy to increase sales of current products to current markets; no change in either the product line or the market segment served is required.</li>
<li class="nl">	<em>Product development:</em> A strategy of selling new or modified products to current markets; this requires innovation in the product line.</li>
<li class="nl">	<em>Market development:</em> A strategy of selling current products to new market segments; this requires identifying new markets to serve.</li>
<li class="nl">	<em>Diversification:</em> A strategy of developing new or modified products and selling them to new markets; this may be achieved through product innovation or through acquiring new businesses to obtain their product lines.</li>
</ol>

</tr>
</table>

<p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. Four market&ndash;product strategies present alternatives for growth opportunities.</p>

<p class="tx">Diversification is the riskiest of the strategies proposed by Ansoff&rsquo;s Matrix. Like the question marks of the BCG Matrix, investing in diversification can lead companies into areas in which they lack the necessary production or marketing expertise.</p>

<p class="tx">Ansoff&rsquo;s Matrix suggests strategies for growth, but downsizing or divestment of SBUs are also options. There are many reasons a company might want to cease investing in some of its products or brands. A company might want to weed out lines that create losses or are marginally profitable or to respond to changes in the marketing environment.</p>

<p class="tx">Consider how application of the BCG Matrix and Ansoff&rsquo;s Matrix might guide strategic planning for Kellogg&rsquo;s, the multinational food manufacturing company. Kellogg&rsquo;s produces ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, including cookies, crackers, savory snacks, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks, frozen waffles, and vegetarian foods, which are manufactured in 21 countries and marketed in over 180 countries to the grocery trade. The cereal products are marketed under the Kellogg&rsquo;s name. The cookies, crackers, chips, and other convenience food brands joined the Kellogg family through acquisition and are generally marketed under their brand names, such as Keebler, Cheez-It, Famous Amos, and Pringles. The health food products, also acquired brands, include Kashi and Morningstar Farms (Kellogg Company, 2017). </p>

<p class="tx">Which of these products are the stars, cash cows, question marks, and dogs of the Kellogg&rsquo;s portfolio? Which deserve a growth strategy, and which might best be phased out? If growth is promising, which of the four strategies suggested by Ansoff&rsquo;s Matrix might work best? Without a seat in the Kellogg&rsquo;s boardroom, we cannot know, but study of Kellogg&rsquo;s product line, annual report, and other publicly available information provides details on which a strategic plan could be based. The links in <em>Field Trip 2.1</em> offer a starting point.</p>

<p class="tx">Let&rsquo;s consider the categories U.S. Morning Foods and U.S. Snacks, drawing from the company&rsquo;s 2016 annual report. From steady sales volume among the core six brands, one might conclude the cash cow of Kellogg&rsquo;s breakfast and snack foods would be its cereal category. Likewise, toaster pastries reported modest net sales and share gains.</p>

<a id="p39"></a>
<p class="tx">The stars appear to be the crackers, which posted sales and share growth, driven in part by innovation in Pringles on-the-go packs.</p>

<p class="tx">The dogs of Kellogg&rsquo;s are its bars. That business declined, dragged down by the Special K diet bar, due to changes in dieting trends away from counting calories. Offsetting that trend was the success of Protein Trail Mix bars, Fruit and Nut bars, Rice Krispies Treats, and Nutri-Grain. This highlights a fault of the BCG Matrix&mdash;the difficulty of defining SBUs. Lumped into Kellogg&rsquo;s SBU &ldquo;bars&rdquo; category are products at different points in their product life cycles, a significant factor that is masked by aggregating them into one unit.</p>

<p class="tx">The question mark of Kellogg&rsquo;s SBUs is its latest entrant&mdash;Special K Nourish cereal with probiotics, launched in August 2017. Kellogg&rsquo;s also plans to position Special K, Mini-Wheats, and Raisin Bran brands around a growing interest in gut health. How will this new SBU of &ldquo;intestinal health products&rdquo; fare?</p>

<p class="tx">Paul Norman, president of Kellogg North America, discussed the launch during a conference call with investment analysts in August 2017. He described recent market developments that led to this strategy: </p>

<p class="ext">Low calorie, low fat has come off trend, and we have obviously been impacted significantly by that. What encourages me as I look forward in where science and nutrition is going and where the trends are . . . really important is gut health and the gut&ndash;brain connection, the importance of the microbiome. (as cited in Watrous, 2017, para. 6) </p>

<p class="tx">According to Norman, Kellogg&rsquo;s is confident in the new SBU: &ldquo;The big wins will come from . . . driving innovation into our adult brands, things like Special K with probiotics, etc., as we go forward&rdquo; (as cited in Watrous, 2017, para. 7).</p>

<p class="tx">Applying Ansoff&rsquo;s Matrix to evaluate growth strategies, we might develop a plan for Kellogg&rsquo;s that emphasizes market penetration for its cash cows at the breakfast table, with a market development strategy for the crackers, perhaps investing in advertising to promote the grab-and-go benefit of its convenience packaging. A product development strategy will likely be deployed to introduce the new Special K Nourish and similar &ldquo;gut health&rdquo; products into current markets.</p>

<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.1.4">Organization of the Marketing Department </h2>
<p class="tx">We began this discussion of marketing in the context of the macro marketing view of companies&rsquo; effect on people and the planet, then narrowed to the micro marketing lens. We introduced the departmental relationships within a company to understand how corporate strategies are selected that marketing departments must execute. Because contributing to those decisions is a key function of the marketing department, we looked at frameworks for making strategic decisions. We now return to this organizational schema, zooming in further to consider what goes on in those marketing departments.</p>

<p class="tx">Depending on the size of the organization, the marketing department might consist of just a few people covering a wide range of functions, or numerous specialists focusing on specific aspects of research, selling, advertising, customer service, and more. Some marketing departments organize around functions, while others organize around geographic territories, brands and product lines, customer markets, or some combination that ensures that each facet of marketing is strategically managed. In the relationship-oriented world of Marketing 3.0, organizing the marketing function around customer relationship management (CRM) has become increasingly common; CRM emphasizes identification and satisfaction of customers&rsquo; needs and wants, supported by a data gathering and analytic processes for maintaining relationships with the best mix of customers. It reflects <strong>market orientation</strong>, a business approach that (consistent with the marketing concept discussed in Chapter 1) focuses the entire organization on three pillars&mdash;customer focus, coordinated marketing, and profitability (Kohli &amp; Jaworski, 1990).</p>

<p class="tx">A market orientation gives the marketing department considerable influence over other departments. Firms with a market orientation find it easier to adopt an <strong>integrated marketing communications (IMC)</strong> approach, which focuses on managing customer relationships over time by linking all initiatives related to brand communications so that audiences encounter a consistent message across all channels (a subject addressed in Chapter 9). Failure to make a market orientation part of an organization&rsquo;s values will likely have a negative effect on the company&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<p class="tx">The marketing department has its own roles and reporting lines, and it has relationships with internal and external partners. (Internal partners are employed by the company, while external partners are linked to it by other relationships, such as a service contract or seat on the board of directors.) In a market-oriented organization, the company groups in the micro environment must be informed about, and aligned with, marketing initiatives. So should service providers to the organization&rsquo;s marketing function, such as ad agencies, vendors, and other channel partners. The marketing department must &ldquo;sell&rdquo; the value of a market orientation to all stakeholders with potential to either positively or negatively affect value creation and the customer experience.</p>

<p class="tx">To summarize the elements of marketing discussed thus far: Marketing takes place in a context of business strategy, which takes place in the framework of macro marketing. The marketing department works with assessments of current performance and growth strategies developed at the highest corporate level using planning tools such as the BCG Matrix and Ansoff&rsquo;s Matrix. The BCG Matrix contributes to understanding SBUs in terms of resource allocation; Ansoff&rsquo;s Matrix contributes to strategy development. Within the corporate framework, marketing organizes its departmental functions and strategic goals to maximize profits while emphasizing a market orientation throughout all stakeholder groups, inside and outside the company.</p>

<a id="p41"></a>
<div class="box-1">
<h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
<p class="tx">Given that marketing departments function within their organization&rsquo;s overall corporate strategy, how influential can they be? If senior managers do not show commitment to the market orientation, what alternatives can the marketing department pursue to do its best&nbsp;work?</p>

<p class="tx">Why are the high-growth but low-share SBUs in a company&rsquo;s business portfolio called&nbsp;question marks? What questions do products in this quadrant raise?</p>
</div>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.1.5">Steps in the Marketing Process</h2>
<p class="tx">Simply put, the marketing process consists of a cycle of logical steps to determine what to do, decide how to do it, and measure how it worked out, in order to determine what to do next. The rest of this chapter will explore that cycle.</p>

<p class="tx">The marketing process involves situation analysis, selection of a marketing strategy, and development of a campaign, followed by execution and measurement. Figure 2.3 presents the marketing process as a series of steps. It should be noted that the first two steps are likely to be interactive&mdash;what is learned in the second step frequently calls for revisiting the first step to find out more. The whole marketing process is iterative, meaning that once finished, it begins again to refine, expand, or change the strategy. Each iteration reacts to how the situation has changed since the previous iteration.</p>

<a id="p42"></a>
<p class="tx">The marketing process helps a business select and attract a customer, make the sale, and please the customer to such an extent that he or she returns and makes referrals. This isn&rsquo;t going to happen without thoughtful planning, so that&rsquo;s where the marketing process begins. To avoid confusing this planning step of the marketing process with strategic planning, remember that the strategic plan comes first. Everything marketers do throughout the marketing process responds to objectives laid out in the company&rsquo;s strategic plan.</p>

<p class="photo-caption">Even a microbusiness like a food truck benefits from performing a situation analysis to find a good match between the company&rsquo;s strengths and potential customers&rsquo; needs.</p>
</div>

<p class="tx">Given our definition of the first step in the marketing process as &ldquo;determining what to do,&rdquo; the process necessarily begins with <strong>situation analysis</strong>, because information about what is happening inside and around a company is essential to decisions about what to do. The situation analysis asks the question &ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo; and then answers it in enough detail to allow marketers to develop a hypothesis about what actions they could take. Because the marketing process must lead to reasonable hypotheses, it requires insight at many levels, including the <strong>macro environment</strong>, the <strong>micro environment</strong>, and the target market. Factors in the macro environment include society/culture, technology, ecology, the economic and political landscape, and the regulatory climate in every market in which the company conducts or plans to conduct business. The micro environment consists of factors specifically affecting the company doing the planning&mdash;its industry, competitors, and operations. The target market concerns the company&rsquo;s current and potential customers.</p>

<a id="p43"></a>
<p class="tx">Situation analysis requires systematic information gathering, followed by examination and evaluation, to identify all relevant data and thus uncover meaningful interrelationships. Done properly, situation analysis guides marketers toward strategies that maximize the fit between the organization&rsquo;s goals and capabilities and emerging marketing opportunities.</p>

<p class="tx">Several analytic tools are discussed here that provide inputs to that choice. Like the marketing process itself, these tools are interactive and iterative; what is learned from one type of analysis might create a need to conduct more analysis of a different kind.</p>

<p class="tx">Note that any marketing objective selected in this step should first of all be achievable. The marketing department is accountable to the organization as a whole, and it will function best when focused on goals it can reasonably expect to accomplish. This is a persuasive reason to give this first step in the marketing process the attention it deserves. </p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.2.1">Environmental Analysis</h2>
<p class="tx">An environmental analysis helps marketers identify an opportunity to fill an unmet customer need or to improve on how competitors&rsquo; products fill a need. Chapter 8 is essential reading related to environmental analysis, with its focus on the marketing environment. </p>

<p class="tx">Finding an achievable strategy based on a meaningful competitive advantage is the key reason for undertaking an environmental analysis. Every company has strengths that make some opportunities more likely to generate success than others. A food truck entrepreneur is more likely to move on an opportunity to open a small restaurant than to open a bicycle repair shop someday. But opportunities arise from customers&rsquo; unmet or poorly met needs, not from entrepreneurs&rsquo; ambitions. When a company finds it is uniquely suited to deliver a product or service, or it has identified a means to deliver better value than existing offerings, it has discovered a strategic competitive advantage. A food truck entrepreneur who learns her customers care deeply about the environment might deploy a fleet of cargo bikes as sales vehicles more suited to its customers&rsquo; humanity-centric orientation and thus gain a competitive advantage.</p>

<p class="tx">Performing an environmental analysis requires looking both inward and outward&mdash;spending time reflecting on what the company is oriented to do well and studying what in the environment might help or hinder the company. In the language of business planning, marketers must conduct <strong>internal analysis</strong> and <strong>external analysis</strong>. </p>

<p class="tx">Internal analysis focuses on inherent capacities of the organization, while external analysis focuses on contextual factors. Internal analysis looks at a company in terms of its story&mdash;where it began, how it reached its current state of operations, what that present state is like, and what plans are made for the future of the organization. Internal analysis focuses on factors inherent to the organization that give it advantages or disadvantages in meeting the needs of its target customers. External analysis, on the other hand, focuses on the environment surrounding the company, including both the micro environment (factors specifically affecting this company) and the macro environment (factors affecting many companies). All the micro and macro environmental factors should be assessed in the external analysis (see Figure 2.4).</p>

</div>


<p class="tx">Each focus of the environmental analysis&mdash;external and internal&mdash;has potential to reveal challenges and opportunities that can then be used in a SWOT analysis. </p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.2.2">SWOT Analysis</h2>
<p class="tx">Like the environmental analysis, the <strong>SWOT analysis</strong> is a key tool in both strategic planning and the marketing process. The SWOT analysis takes the factors identified by the environmental analysis and examines their potential for positive or negative impact. This framework for analyzing internal and external forces affecting the business either positively or negatively is depicted in Table 2.2. The acronym derives from strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.</p>

<p class="tx">Consider the example of Pulling Down the Moon, a Chicago-based service providing yoga classes, acupuncture, massage therapy, and nutritional counseling to women undergoing fertility treatments. The company, founded in 2002, had four offices in the Chicago area and one outside Washington, D.C., by 2011.</p>

<p class="tx">In 2004 cofounders Beth Heller and Tami Quinn opened an office in downtown Chicago near one of the nation&rsquo;s largest fertility clinics, to make referrals and appointments easy and thus capture a stream of clients. Fertility Centers of Illinois agreed to sublease to the entrepreneurs a studio on the ground floor along Chicago&rsquo;s Riverwalk. All went well&mdash;until in July 2010 a flood damaged the first floor. The company relocated temporarily. Its landlord, the fertility center, decided to use the occasion to undergo a total redesign of its space, adding months before Pulling Down the Moon could return to permanent quarters.</p>

<p class="tx">Just 1 day before the anniversary of that first flood, another flood sent water into the building. Damage was moderate enough that Pulling Down the Moon was able to stay in place while restoration work was done, but the threat posed by the riverfront location was clearer than ever (Grossmann, 2011a).</p>

<p class="tx">If you were one of the owners of this business, what would you do? With so many factors one cannot plan for, why maintain a location that can become a strategic threat whenever the river rises? Table 2.3 summarizes a hypothetical SWOT analysis regarding Pulling Down the Moon&rsquo;s location.</p>

<a id="p46"></a>
<p class="tx">Pulling Down the Moon founders Heller and Quinn have developed a business with a clear mission and market. Analysis helped them reach a decision affecting a fundamental marketing strategy: their location decision. After the second flood, they chose to stay in place on Chicago&rsquo;s riverfront. The decision to stay was not an easy one. However, the owners felt the positives of the location, which supported their mission to integrate holistic medicine with traditional Western medicine, outweighed negatives such as the increased insurance premiums that resulted (Grossmann, 2011b).</p>

<h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 2.3: </strong><em>SWOT Analysis Examples</em></h1>
<p class="tx">Follow this link to more examples of SWOT analysis.</p>
<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://articles.bplans.com/swot-analysis-examples">https://articles.bplans.com/swot-analysis-examples</a>
</div>


<p class="tx">Analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats has been used as a tool to assist strategic planning since the 1960s. It remains effective in helping organizations choose marketing objectives that take into account both the organizations&rsquo; capabilities and external market opportunities, because it promotes proactive planning and decision making.</p>

<p class="tx">A SWOT analysis should always be performed when a company first creates a strategic plan. After that, a SWOT review should be conducted at least annually&mdash;and more frequently if changes in the marketing environment or internal organization warrant it. The focus of the review can be company-wide or specific to an SBU or a specific decision, such as whether to pursue an acquisition or merger.</p>

<p class="tx">Consultants Sarah Simoneaux and Chris Stroud (2011) characterize the SWOT analysis as &ldquo;looking in the mirror&rdquo; and &ldquo;looking out the door&rdquo; (p. 76). The mirror represents the firm&rsquo;s internal attributes, judged to be either strengths or weaknesses. The door represents external attributes in the environment, which may present opportunities or threats (Simoneaux &amp; Stroud, 2011). </p>

<p class="tx">Key factors suggested by Simoneaux and Stroud to consider in the SWOT analysis include (but are not limited to) the following areas:</p>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">corporate culture (including vision, mission, and values)</li>
<li class="bl">current positioning strategies</li>
<li class="bl">customer or client base</li>
<li class="bl">customer service</li>
<li class="bl">distribution channel/supply chain partners</li>
<li class="bl">financial performance</li>
<li class="bl">innovation</li>
<li class="bl">management team</li>
<li class="bl">product/service quality</li>
<li class="bl">sales force</li>
<li class="bl">staff requirements</li>
<li class="bl">utilization of technology</li>
</ul>

<a id="p47"></a>
<p class="tx">The process of conducting a SWOT analysis begins with reviewing the touchstones of corporate vision, mission, and values. A typical SWOT process will include a facilitator and planning group drawn from different business departments and job functions. The team members will meet in an environment that allows them to think creatively and brainstorm about strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. In highly competitive situations, planners repeat the process, focusing on major competitors. This can lead to important insights that help planners envision a number of potential scenarios.</p>

<p class="tx">Some marketing leaders consider the SWOT analysis somewhat simplistic. If used without sufficient environmental analysis, it can lead to a misrepresentation of a company and its situation (Koch, 2000). The chief objection to the SWOT analysis is that it conflates two important and distinct approaches&mdash;<strong>competitor analysis</strong> and <strong>trend analysis</strong>. Strengths and weaknesses are relative to competitors in the marketplace, while threats and opportunities reflect trends and patterns in the external environment. To combine the two invites fuzzy thinking (D. Van Mell, personal communication, January 19, 2018).</p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.2.3">Other Analytic Approaches</h2>
<p class="tx">Marketing practitioners use a number of tools to frame their situation analysis, and diverse terms or names are used for these approaches. You may find reference to environmental scanning, competitive intelligence, market position analysis, and more. All are used with the same intent&mdash;to understand what is going on, in order to determine what to do.</p>

<p class="tx">To summarize, the goal of a situation analysis (regardless of which analytic tools are used) is to match a firm&rsquo;s capabilities to market opportunities. When a situation analysis reveals something customers value, something a company can do better than any competitor, marketing planners have struck gold. The following example shows how the business known today as Patio Foods was born from a situation analysis that struck (frozen) gold in a challenging external environment in the late 1950s.</p>

<p class="photo-caption">The Stumberg family business&rsquo;s internal analysis revealed a declining customer base but an asset in their infrastructure and distribution systems. The company became a leading purveyor of Tex-Mex TV dinners.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.2.4">Situation Analysis Example: Patio Foods</h2>
<p class="tx">When the Stumberg family in San Antonio, Texas, turned to selling frozen Mexican food, it was an act of desperation.</p>

<p class="tx">Henry Stumberg started a frozen vegetable business in 1946 with his sons Ed and Louis in San Antonio, but prices for frozen vegetables plummeted when other companies entered the national market. Competition knocked the bottom out of the Stumberg family business, which sold to supermarkets throughout Texas. Ed Stumberg observed that the five military bases in San Antonio were creating new fans for Tex-Mex cuisine. He reasoned that they might want to continue eating Tex-Mex when they returned home. The Stumbergs began shipping frozen tamales and chili across the state. In the late 1950s they formed Patio Foods and went on to distribute Tex-Mex food as TV dinners nationwide.</p>

<a id="p48"></a>
<p class="tx">We can only guess what went on around the Stumberg family&rsquo;s conference room or dinner table as the family business made its shift from frozen vegetables to TV dinners. While they may not have explicitly applied the tools described here, it&rsquo;s likely the idea emerged from what we would recognize as a situation analysis. Their environmental analysis, beginning with internal analysis, would reveal a declining customer base as price competition ate into frozen vegetable sales but an existing asset in infrastructure (freezers) and distribution systems. External analysis of the micro environment would reveal enthusiasm for Tex-Mex food among military personnel on the local bases. Analysis of the macro environment would reveal the growing popularity of the new frozen product called a TV dinner (introduced by C. A. Swanson &amp; Sons in 1953). Their SWOT analysis would bring to light how their internal strengths and weaknesses fit with external opportunities and threats&mdash;that their supply and distribution capacities and expertise in Tex-Mex products was an excellent fit to the growing market of Tex-Mex enthusiasts. </p>

<p class="tx">The marketing opportunity the Stumbergs discovered in the face of competition for frozen vegetable sales carried them to financial triumph. Patio Foods was acquired by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1967 as part of its effort to diversify its product line in the face of antismoking sentiment (Mufson, 1999) Louis Stumberg was named vice chair of RJR Foods Inc., the tobacco company&rsquo;s food and beverage subsidiary. Subsequent acquisitions took the brand to Del Monte, ConAgra Foods, and most recently J&amp;J Snack Brands (Hendricks, 2011). </p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.2.5">Situation Analysis Requires Research</h2>
<p class="tx">Situation analysis is where the process that leads to customer loyalty and referrals begins. But planning should never take place in a vacuum. The situation analysis will require more information before it can be considered complete. Market research will fill in the unknowns that have come to light as marketers look for opportunities to support the company&rsquo;s strategic goals.</p>

<p class="tx">Internal analysis rarely requires research, as it is usually a straightforward process. Unless the company is a recent acquisition, its planners will have a strong sense of its history, current situation, and future direction. If research is needed for the internal analysis, it will be to quantify certain factors like market share or to gain insights into current customers through analysis of sales records, results of past marketing campaigns, and so on.</p>

<p class="tx">External analysis tends to be more complex and is likely to raise more questions. Research will be needed to find out about competitors, potential target markets, industry and consumer trends, and more. At this point, marketing planners put the situation analysis on hold while they conduct the research needed to fill in these blanks. Chapter 8 explores external analysis in depth as part of its examination of the marketing environment.</p>

<p class="tx">Once research has produced the needed information, marketing planners circle back to this step in the marketing process to finish their situation analysis. When complete, it is a document that summarizes opportunities to satisfy customer needs. It will also summarize problems that must be resolved in order to take advantage of those opportunities. </p>

<a id="p49"></a>
<p class="tx">Plans are most effective when documented in writing. A company&rsquo;s strategic plan will typically exist as a written document disseminated to managers throughout the organization. The marketing department will produce a marketing plan document, which will include the situation analysis as a rationale for the strategies selected for execution. The document describes in detail what will take place and why&mdash;and how effectiveness will be measured&mdash;for each campaign. Chapter 9 includes a more detailed discussion of these documents used by marketing managers.</p>

<div class="box-1">
<h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
<p class="tx">Imagine yourself in a situation like the Stumbergs of Patio Foods. You&rsquo;ve got freezers and a distribution system and too much competition for the frozen vegetable business you once pursued profitably. Let&rsquo;s say you were growing fruit, not vegetables, and located in Seattle, Washington, instead of San Antonio, Texas. Apply internal and external analysis to your current situation. Can you find a new market opportunity?</p>

<p class="tx">This second step in the marketing process has the goal of choosing an approach to take advantage of what has been learned about the situation. What objective should marketing try to achieve? But it would be premature to make a hypothesis about what to do before gathering more information. Therefore, marketers begin this step by conducting research. Their task is to provide the specific market information necessary to develop a <strong>marketing strategy</strong>&mdash;a plan to target a market segment and design a marketing mix that will profitably deliver value to those customers. The foremost reason to conduct market research is to gain a deep understanding of customer needs by identifying segments worthy of targeting and finding value propositions that will resonate with them&mdash;in other words, to support the three components of the STP approach.</p>

<p class="tx">Every company needs a deep understanding of its specific situation regarding the CVE. Without that knowledge, a company cannot fully take advantage of the opportunity presented by unmet customer needs. The outcome of this step will be a <strong>value proposition</strong>&mdash;a statement that targets potential customers and describes why they should buy a specific offering from a specific company (as discussed in Chapter 1). The concept of the value proposition is credited to Rosser Reeves, chair of the Ted Bates &amp; Co. advertising agency in the 1950s, who dubbed it the <strong>unique selling proposition (USP)</strong> (Daye, 2010).</p>



<p class="tx">Reeves was one of the first to develop a technique for communicating in an overcrowded marketplace. His definition of what makes a USP or value proposition holds true today. According to Reeves, a value proposition has three component parts. First, it must make a proposition to the potential customer: &ldquo;Buy this, and you will receive a specified benefit.&rdquo; Second, that proposition must be something no competitor can claim or that competitors have not chosen to emphasize in their promotions. Finally, the proposition must be so compelling that it motivates individuals to act.</p>

<p class="tx">Consider how the Mars candy company slogan for M&amp;M&rsquo;s delivers the three required components.</p>

<a id="p50"></a>
<div class="photo-right">

<p class="photo-caption">The M&amp;M&rsquo;s slogan promises a specific benefit that no competing candy claims.</p>
</div>

<p class="ext">&ldquo;M&amp;M&rsquo;s melt in your mouth, not in your hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tx">The slogan promises a specific benefit that no competing candy claims and that will compel people wary of messy chocolate to action.</p>

<p class="tx">A concept closely related to the value proposition is positioning&mdash;marketers&rsquo; practice of creating an image or identity in the minds of prospective customers that allows one offering to stand out among many. The identity created through positioning reflects the reasoning behind the value proposition and the promise made by the USP. This suite of concepts is explored in more depth in Chapter 6.</p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.3.1">Reasons for Market Research</h2>
<p class="tx">Recall from Chapter 1 that market research is defined as the collection and analysis of data to produce information for decision making. The market research conducted in step 2 of the marketing process produces the information needed to find a value proposition&mdash;the unique and compelling promise of customer benefits on which marketing strategy can be based. Marketers do research to become better informed about customers&rsquo; needs and desires, about emerging market opportunities, and about changes in customers&rsquo; attitudes and purchase patterns. This information increases marketers&rsquo; ability to make informed strategic decisions. Later in the marketing process, market research is conducted to refine campaigns being developed and to measure results after the marketing strategy&rsquo;s execution.</p>

<p class="tx">Current practice in market research is being driven by a need for businesses to be more agile&mdash;to be able to respond to conditions with a pivot to a new strategy with speed. This moves the emphasis to <strong>primary research</strong> (conducted by market researchers directly) as opposed to <strong>secondary research</strong> (information found in existing published sources). The macro environment is moving at such a pace that by the time published sources become available, the information may have become obsolete.</p>

<p class="tx">Another way to categorize types of research is by their purpose. <strong>Exploratory research</strong> generates insights about a situation. It helps marketers determine the nature of a problem, define issues, and suggest hypotheses. It can often lead to new lines of inquiry and further research. It is not typically used for decision making but rather to gather preliminary information. Exploratory research may also delve deeper into trends coming to light in the situation analysis. A typical example of exploratory research might be an inquiry into whether an innovative product idea can be profitably developed. </p>

<a id="p51"></a>
<p class="tx">Following exploratory research comes <strong>conclusive research</strong>, which serves the purpose of verifying the insights generated from exploratory research. Conclusive research typically involves a more systematic, structured method of data collection and analysis. Conclusive research needs to result in statistically and scientifically valid results that can support predictions (the hypotheses generated from exploratory research). The purpose of conclusive research is to help marketers determine which of several proposed strategies is most likely to succeed (Pride &amp; Ferrell, 2017). </p>

<p class="tx">In the marketing strategy phase we are discussing, marketing research typically focuses on the following aspects:</p>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">consumer behavior, to select market segments to target</li>
<li class="bl">innovation, to discover a target market&rsquo;s unmet or poorly met needs and then find ideas for products or services to fill those needs or fill them better</li>
<li class="bl">competitors&rsquo; strategies, to find a value proposition based on a benefit that competitors cannot or have not chosen to claim</li>
</ul>

<p class="tx">Later in the marketing process, in the campaign development and measurement steps, research will have different objectives.</p>

<p class="tx">Let&rsquo;s look closer at research into consumer behavior, perhaps the most essential of the areas listed above, since without a target market a company will likely try to be &ldquo;all things to all people&rdquo; and thus fail to develop a compelling value proposition.</p>


<h2 class="h2"  id="sec2.3.2">Research to Understand Consumer Behavior</h2>
<p class="tx">Have you ever responded to a telephone survey? Returned a questionnaire received in the mail? Been asked to take a short survey when you leave a website? If so, you&rsquo;ve been on the receiving end of market research. What were marketers&rsquo; reasons for conducting the research? Most likely, they were looking to understand your behavior&mdash;not you, specifically, but the market segment of which you represent one sample individual.</p>

<p class="tx">Research that helps marketers understand consumer behavior will lead to identification of distinct market segments. Among those segments, research will reveal which are likely to offer profitable customers. Thus begins the fundamental marketing task of segmentation and targeting.</p>

<p class="tx">Back in the production and sales eras, marketers were product-centric. They made few distinctions among types of consumers. That strategy was later replaced with consumer-centric strategies in the marketing era, in which targeting systems emerged, primarily based on demographic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics. As the relationship era brought appreciation for customer lifetime value, companies sought even more information from consumers, blending in purchase history and shopping behavior. Reflecting this progression, the execution of marketing campaigns has evolved from mass-market advertising through targeted campaigns toward one-to-one messaging driven by customer data. To achieve the level of consumer insight necessary for targeting, segmentation, and one-to-one messaging, marketers need to collect data&mdash;hence the demand for market research.</p>

<a id="p52"></a>
<p class="tx">The types of data collected can be <em>quantitative</em> or <em>qualitative</em>. <strong>Quantitative research</strong> methods produce numeric data using structured questions. It is useful when there is no ambiguity about the concepts being measured. Exploratory research is more likely to be designed to collect qualitative data, typically from a relatively small sample. Examples of quantitative data gathering include</p>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">surveys (measuring the opinions or experiences of a group of people via a set of questions);</li>
<li class="bl">sampling (getting opinions from people representative of a specific group); and</li>
<li class="bl">data reports (detailing the data collected, how it was analyzed, and the conclusions drawn from the data).</li>
</ul>

<p class="tx">Firms used to draw heavily on the secondary research approach, drawing on resources like the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Consumer Expenditure Survey represents research gathered by <em>primary</em> quantitative methods. When marketers draw on data from this survey in their research, they are conducting <em>secondary</em> quantitative research&mdash;because they did not directly collect the data they are using. However, the lag time between data collection and dissemination is causing marketers, who need up-to-the-minute data to drive their hypotheses and decisions, to turn more frequently to primary research methods and qualitative data collection techniques.</p>

<p class="tx"><strong>Qualitative research</strong> methods are helpful in hazier situations, in which it would be difficult to develop structured questions. Qualitative research methods bring to light perceptions and feelings and help reveal problems and opportunities. Conclusive research is more likely to rely on quantitative data, gathered from a larger sample population. Examples of qualitative data gathering include</p>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">customer advisory boards,</li>
<li class="bl">focus groups,</li>
<li class="bl">interviews,</li>
<li class="bl">mall intercepts, </li>
<li class="bl">social listening, and</li>
<li class="bl">ethnography.</li>
</ul>

<p class="tx"><strong>Customer advisory boards</strong> are groups of existing customers, convened at regular intervals to advise management on trends and priorities from their perspective. These advisory boards or councils provide opportunities for cocreation and engagement.</p>

<p class="tx"><strong>Focus groups</strong> involve selecting a small number of people (typically 6 to 12) representative of the consumer segment being studied, and then guiding a discussion to discover what they think or feel about a particular subject. </p>

<p class="tx"><strong>Interviews</strong> involve a one-to-one conservation to gather information. <strong>Mall intercepts</strong> are short interviews conducted by randomly stopping and asking questions of shoppers in a mall. </p>

<p class="tx"><strong>Social listening</strong> consists of monitoring online conversations to understand what customers are saying about a brand or industry.</p>

<a id="p53"></a>
<p class="tx"><strong>Ethnography</strong> is a type of qualitative research involving a detailed study of a group to describe its behavior, characteristics, cultural mores, and the like. Retail ethnography is a particularly interesting type of qualitative research that applies ethnography&rsquo;s techniques to consumer behavior, such as shopping choices.</p>

<p class="tx">An increasingly useful type of quantitative research is <strong>netnography</strong> (a term derived from <em>Internet</em> and <em>ethnography</em>). Netnography is a branch of ethnography that analyzes the self-directed behavior of individuals on the Internet to provide useful insights. After Starbucks introduced its VIA Ready Brew powdered coffee beans in single-serve packets, netnography helped the company&rsquo;s marketers confirm that customers weren&rsquo;t reacting negatively to the fact that the iconic brand was now selling &ldquo;instant coffee.&rdquo; Comments in online communities trended positive (Nguyen, 2012).</p>

<p class="tx">The examples in Table 2.4 suggest how these different types of research produce different types of information. </p>

<p class="tx">Lab42, a market research survey platform provider, used primary, quantitative research to help an independent consultant answer three questions concerning consumer behavior:</p>

<ol class="nl">
<li class="nl">	At what age did women start using makeup, and who taught them how to apply it?</li>
<li class="nl">	How did women choose their preferred brands of makeup?</li>
<li class="nl">	How often did women purchase makeup?</li>
</ol>

<p class="tx">Lab42 fielded an online survey to women aged 18&ndash;30. The firm deployed the survey across a variety of social networks. It added ambiguous qualifying questions to the beginning of the survey to ensure it was reaching out only to women of the target age group. Lab42 was able to help the client slice the data into various market segments and understand how the data answered the three research questions, thus determining the target markets for a niche makeup brand with the most profit potential. </p>

<h2 class="h2"  id="sec2.3.3">Conducting Market Research</h2>
<p class="tx">Now that we&rsquo;ve explored why this second step of the marketing process requires research and what types of research can be conducted, we turn to the question &ldquo;How is market research conducted?&rdquo; There are five steps in the process:</p>

<ol class="nl">
<li class="nl">	Problem definition: Statement of the purpose for research, usually a question tied to one of the reasons for research identified earlier in this chapter.</li>
<li class="nl">	Research design: Selection of a research method (primary or secondary) and data type (quantitative or qualitative) for the research project.</li>
<li class="nl">	Data collection: Implementation of the research project as defined and designed in previous steps. This may involve conducting fieldwork to collect primary data or gathering information from secondary data sources.</li>
<li class="nl">	Data analysis: Use of descriptive statistics of quantitative data and/or summaries of qualitative data to turn information into insight.</li>
<li class="nl">	Report presentation: The writing up of findings to express insights or new knowledge gained, for presentation to management and other stakeholders.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p class="tx">Figure 2.5 highlights these steps.</p>

<p class="tx">A complex problem may require several types of research, such as a focus group to generate ideas for a value proposition, followed by a questionnaire to test the appeal of several versions of the value proposition. In that case step 2 would describe each research initiative; steps 3 and 4 would include separate steps of data collection and analysis for each initiative. Step 5 would bring the results of all initiatives together in a final presentation.</p>

<p class="tx">To review the marketing process so far:</p>

<ol class="nl">
<li class="nl">	Situation analysis: Identify opportunities to fill unmet customer needs.</li>
<li class="nl">	Marketing strategy: Design and conduct research; develop segmentation, targeting, and positioning strategies.</li>
</ol>

<p class="tx">Once marketers have conducted research, they fold the results into their strategic planning. One hypothesis about &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; to achieve the goals described in the company&rsquo;s strategic plan will be chosen to drive this iteration of the marketing process. That hypothesis becomes the marketing strategy. With the first and second steps of the marketing process complete, marketers can move on to the campaign development phase.</p>

<a id="p55"></a>
<div class="box-1">
<h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
<p class="tx">Returning to the Patio Foods example discussed earlier in this chapter, consider how creators of the TV dinner might have used market research to identify a target market, discover new product ideas, find a compelling value proposition, or detect market trends. Choose one of these research purposes and describe a research project for a frozen meal business.</p>
</div>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec2.4">2.4&ensp;Marketing Process Step 3: Campaign Development</h1>

<p class="tx">In this step, marketers make decisions covering components of the marketing mix&mdash;product development, pricing, place (including both location and distribution issues), and promotions. Their goal is to develop a campaign plan in response to the opportunity identified in the first step, situation analysis, that creatively communicates to the target market the value proposition identified in the second step, marketing strategy.</p>

<p class="tx"><strong>Campaign development</strong> demands a marketing mix based on what a company is selling to a target market and how the company plans to reach it. Each campaign strategy will specify a <strong>message channel</strong> and a value proposition chosen to reach a specific target market and a <strong>call to action</strong> that will move individuals in that niche to take a specific next step&mdash;engage, purchase, recommend, join, and so on.</p>

<p class="tx">The message channel is the medium, such as a radio station, website, or mailing list, used by marketers to deliver a message to a target audience. Message channels are categorized by the type of audience they reach, which may be mass market, targeted, or individual (one-to-one). The choice of message channel is driven by the strategies of the marketing mix, most directly by strategic decisions in the promotions quadrant.</p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.4.1">The Shift From Mass-Market Toward One-to-One Campaigns</h2>
<p class="tx">Any discussion of campaign development today must acknowledge the tremendous increase in computing power that has made <strong>one-to-one marketing</strong> possible. The arrival of technology capable of managing vast databases has created an opportunity for marketers to shift from campaigns driven by use of mass-market message channels to much more effective and cost-efficient processes that reach individuals one by one.</p>

<p class="tx">A compelling reason companies rely on targeted marketing strategies is to focus spending on those most likely to buy. Today many companies employ one-to-one marketing&mdash;a highly sophisticated method of tailoring messages and delivering them to individuals.</p>

<p class="tx">Marketers must choose message channels that reach the target market they&rsquo;ve selected. They must also make sure the campaign they&rsquo;re developing adheres to other parameters laid out for the campaign in the marketing strategy, such as budget and time period needed to accomplish each goal.</p>

<a id="p56"></a>
<p class="tx">Mass-market campaigns push an advertising message to an audience through mass media, using message channels such as television, radio, social media, or newspapers. Targeted campaigns use tailored channels to reach specific market segments, such as people in a specific geographic area (for example, readers of <em>Chicago</em> magazine) or those who share an interest (e.g., listeners to an all-gospel radio station). One-to-one campaigns push an advertising message to an individual using a one-to-one message channel, typically direct mail or e-mail.</p>

<p class="tx">Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have become tools for one-to-one marketing, as well, blending aspects of market research, lead generation, and customer service. Banks of digital marketers engage in social listening, observing customers&rsquo; mentions of their brand or industry in social media and drawing insights from that aggregated data. Salespeople mine online profiles for details they can use in rapport-building with prospects, such as photographs showing vacations or hobbies. Online customer care staff monitor social streams for complaints, then reach out to individuals to resolve the issue. Each can be seen as a one-to-one message channel, because communication originates with a single online message.</p>

<p class="tx">Marketers selling products and services that are needed by just about everybody have little need to move toward one-to-one campaign techniques. If the appeal of a value proposition is broad enough, mass media is a good choice to convey the message. Because so many people eat fast food, use skin care products, and prepare their taxes every year, you see these offerings marketed in the mass media. When politicians run for office, they want every vote, and so they use mass media.</p>

<p class="tx">On the other hand, marketers know that today&rsquo;s consumers are eager for dialogue and engagement. They prefer a personal approach to a &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; campaign. Marketers have learned that using techniques closer to the one-to-one end of the spectrum can be more effective with certain types of offerings. Ads aimed at niches can appear in online as well as in traditional broadcast or print message channels. Either can be considered fairly targeted but not yet one-to-one, because no individual has been specified to receive the message.</p>

<p class="tx">Volkswagen did a superior job of creating advertisements that match specific brands to specific target markets, even though using mass media as a message channel. A series of TV commercials created in 2000 showed Volkswagen&rsquo;s different car models matched to different life stages, depicting typical buyers moving from their first Golf as teenagers, through a Jetta for their carefree &ldquo;singleton&rdquo; years, and purchasing a Passat or Touareg minivan when the babies start coming.</p>

<p class="tx">Catalog marketers were among the first to use customer purchase data to drive campaigns toward more tightly targeted niches. A woman who buys maternity clothes from a general JCPenney catalog will soon start receiving smaller catalogs from JCPenney displaying maternity fashions only. Before long, a baby-products catalog will follow.</p>

<p class="tx">Taking targeting to the one-to-one level, direct-mail food merchandiser the Wisconsin Cheeseman began inserting a customized order form into every holiday catalog as soon as printing technology allowed it. The company mailed catalogs to past customers preprinted with each individual customer&rsquo;s order from the prior year, making it supremely easy to order the same products again each holiday.</p>

<a id="p57"></a>
<p class="tx">To deploy one-to-one campaigns, marketers must have access to a database of customer and/or product information. Have you ever received an invitation to schedule a health care screening right around your birthday? Have you received a mailer from your car dealership on the anniversary of your last purchase, suggesting you might like to trade up to a newer car? These are examples of data-driven one-to-one marketing campaigns, directed to you based on information on file about you.</p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.4.2">Share of Market or Share of Customer?</h2>
<p class="tx">With mass-market campaigns, marketers hope to increase their share of the marketplace. In other words, if 100 people exist who might buy a thingamajig, the makers of Acme brand thingamajigs use mass-media advertising to get as many of those 100 people as possible to make a purchase, winning market share away from competitors.</p>

<p class="tx">With one-to-one marketing, the focus shifts from capturing <em>share of market</em> to <em>share of cus</em><em></em><em>tomer</em>, gaining more of individuals&rsquo; purchases over their lifetimes. With this strategy, the marketers at Acme hope to get each of those 100 people in the habit of buying Acme brand thingamajigs repeatedly.</p>

<p class="tx">One-to-one marketing can be a company&rsquo;s only campaign strategy or a supplement to mass-market campaigns. If used as a supplement&mdash;part of a strategy to drive both share of market and share of customer&mdash;the messages must be coordinated.</p>

<p class="tx">Table 2.5 illustrates where different types of message channels fall on the spectrum from mass-market to one-to-one campaigns. Most marketers combine techniques to increase both market share and lifetime share of the customer.</p>

<p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. Message channels occupy a place on a spectrum from mass-market to one-to-one approaches, with targeted message channels in between.</p>

<a id="p58"></a>
<p class="tx">The ability to conduct one-to-one campaigns raises ethical issues. The promise of one-to-one marketing is that consumers benefit from it; more of the messages they receive are tailored more closely to their needs and interests. But consumers can perceive one-to-one marketing as intrusive, especially as concerns mount about the security of personal information. The responsibility lies with marketers to ask permission for the data they collect and not to exploit customer data beyond reasonable boundaries. We&rsquo;ll return to this subject in Chapter&nbsp;10.</p>

<p class="tx">Other elements of the campaign development step include creation of a media plan and an evaluation plan. The <em>media plan</em> specifies what message channels will be used and on what schedule. Today&rsquo;s media plans usually combine mass media, targeted media, and one-to-one messaging, including social media as well as traditional channels. The <em>evaluation plan</em> addresses how the effectiveness of marketing messages will be measured. These plans will be defined and explained in Chapter 9&rsquo;s discussion of the media planning function.</p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.4.3">Another Round of Research for Campaign Development</h2>
<p class="tx">The campaign development stage of the marketing process is almost complete once the decisions about marketing mix, message channel strategy, media plan, and evaluation plan have been made. There&rsquo;s just one more task for marketers before moving on to execution: research to make sure the decisions made so far are sound.</p>

<p class="tx">Depending on a company&rsquo;s management structure and relationships, it may need to secure final approval of a campaign before executing it. An ad agency will need to get its client company&rsquo;s approval; a marketing department may need approval of the firm&rsquo;s chief executive officer (CEO) or chief marketing officer (CMO). Research with the target audience that provides evidence of sound strategy is very helpful in gaining approval when presenting concepts to decision makers inside the company or ad agency.</p>

<p class="tx">Consider the following example: A Wisconsin advertising agency was asked to develop an antismoking campaign targeted at middle-school-aged (sixth- to eighth-grade) youths (Olderman, 2011). The advertising agency strategists viewed videos from national antismoking campaigns, analyzing which appeals were used. Following this preliminary work, the agency developed three campaign concepts.</p>

<ol class="nl">
<li class="nl">	Smoking is bad for your health.</li>
<li class="nl">	Smoking makes you less attractive.</li>
<li class="nl">	Big tobacco companies are trying to manipulate you into smoking.</li>
</ol>

<p class="tx">To which proposition would young people respond most strongly? To find out, the agency conducted focus groups around the state. The pitch highlighting health negatives did not move the youths at all. They responded more strongly to the caution about reduced attractiveness, but not by much. The proposition that really got their attention was the affront to their independence and autonomy they sensed in the third concept. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Big Tobacco manipulate you&rdquo; became the theme of the ad campaign against teen smoking (Wisconsin Department of Health Services, 2018). This example shows how market research produced insights into which campaign message should be selected for execution. We&rsquo;ll return to this example in the context of the final step of the marketing process, measurement.</p>

<a id="p59"></a>
<p class="tx">During the campaign development stage of the marketing process, marketers apply the four Ps of the marketing mix; they select a strategy that describes how the campaign will use mass-market, targeted, and one-to-one message channels; and finally, the marketers develop a campaign message based on an underlying value proposition. After testing the message to be sure it will work, the next step is execution&mdash;rolling out the campaign. At this point, the marketing strategy can be documented in a written marketing plan, to control the actions that follow.</p>

<div class="box-1">
<h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>

<p class="tx">What blend of mass-market, targeted, or one-to-one message channels do you think will be most effective in reaching customers?</p>
</div>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec2.5">2.5&ensp;Marketing Process Step 4: Execution</h1>

<p class="tx">In this step, marketers implement the campaign they&rsquo;ve developed, and then monitor its execution and adjust the campaign if needed. The marketing strategy identified in the second step of the marketing process comes to life. </p>

<p class="tx"><strong>Execution</strong> of a mass-market campaign involves buying media and filling it with persuasive content or creating a social media environment that reaches a community of interest in less traditional ways. The media plan (created during campaign development) specifies which message channels will be used, including any or all on the spectrum from mass media to one-to-one, including print, broadcast, or social media. Media planning is a specialized function within an ad agency or marketing department.</p>

<p class="tx">Once the media plan is in place, content must be created to fill it. Every piece of the plan, from the briefest radio spot to the most elaborate video production, requires creative execution. Execution puts the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; in this important marketing function. While all art directors work within the framework dictated by the marketing strategy, their creativity brings the strategy to life. The people who write, produce, photograph, illustrate, create soundtracks, and otherwise fill media channels with content are artists engaged in creating popular culture.

</div>

<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.5.1">Data Drives One-to-One Campaigns </h2>
<p class="tx">With the shift to one-to-one marketing, execution demands not just one advertising message but an entire system of elements driven by fields in a database. A specialized printing technique called <strong>variable data printing</strong> makes it possible to print and deliver mail pieces that are customized right down to the individual recipient. Without this technique, the Wisconsin Cheeseman could not have inserted a personalized order form into each customer&rsquo;s catalog. E-mail and websites can be personalized with variable data in the same way printed pieces can.</p>

<p class="tx">Fields in a database drive more than just names&mdash;each element of a printed or online communication piece, including the images, benefit statements, and offers, can change based on data about the recipient. It&rsquo;s common for marketers to use images that mirror each recipient&rsquo;s age, gender, and ethnicity. The data that drives one-to-one campaigns comes from a sophisticated <strong>data warehouse</strong> containing information from sales, marketing, and customer service activities. Without the data warehouse, there would be no data fields to drive the variable messages and nowhere for data about the outcome to accumulate.</p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.5.2">Monitoring the Campaign</h2>
<p class="tx">Once the media planners and creative department have finished their work and the campaign launches, is execution complete? No; marketers must monitor all the media channels used to be sure each component is executed as planned.</p>

<p class="tx">Radio and TV messages can be bumped by breaking news. Playback of the messages can be garbled due to technical glitches. Mail pieces can be misdelivered. E-mail can be trapped in spam filters. Online campaigns can go off track when servers go down, which can result when a successful promotion generates more response than expected. For example, when Marvel Entertainment announced at SXSW in 2013 that it would offer seven hundred No. 1 issues of popular comic books free for digital download for the next 2 days, its technology partner, comiXology, was unprepared. Within a day its servers had crashed. The freebies had to be halted temporarily. ComiXology rewrote its code for delivering the free download, inserting a registration step that allowed it to moderate the flow of interest enough to allow its servers to keep up (Cheredar, 2013).</p>

<a id="p61"></a>
<p class="tx">Marketers must ensure that make-goods (refunds for ads that do not run as scheduled) are issued if another company is at fault, such as a particular television station or e-mail distribution service. If the company is at fault, execution plans must be adjusted to remedy the error and get the campaign back on track.</p>

<p class="tx">Another form of monitoring also takes place during the execution step: monitoring the creative work on the campaign as it is developed, to be sure it stays aligned with the strategic plan. Creative people tend to want to push limits. Someone on the team must counter that tendency by monitoring that each decision regarding the four Ps of the marketing mix is reflected in the creative execution. In an ad agency, this might fall to someone with the title of traffic manager or account manager. In a corporate marketing department, the title might be marketing manager or marketing director. If monitoring the campaign reveals problems, then adjustments must be made to get the campaign back into alignment with the strategic plan.</p>

<p class="tx">In summary, the fourth step in the marketing process, execution, involves the tasks of specifying which message channels will be used (described in a media plan), creating content to fill the message channels, and monitoring that the messages stay aligned with strategy and get delivered according to plan. When one-to-one messaging is called for, data must be available to drive it&mdash;therefore, execution also involves data management.</p>

<div class="box-1">
<h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
<p class="tx">Careers in marketing mentioned in relation to the execution step include media planning and creating content for advertising and other marketing communications, as well as traffic and account managers. Earlier steps involved the work of strategic planners and researchers&mdash;other careers in marketing. Does one or more of these career opportunities interest you? Why?</p>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec2.6">2.6&ensp;Marketing Process Step 5: Measurement</h1>

<p class="tx">In the marketing process, there would be no sales without execution of marketing campaigns. And without sales, there&rsquo;s no opportunity to please customers. To discover whether campaigns are effective in not just attracting customers but also making sales, there&rsquo;s only one thing to do: measure them. In the <strong>measurement</strong> step of the marketing process, marketers use research to measure the impact of the marketing strategy that has made its way through campaign development and execution.</p>

<p class="tx">Two fundamental information needs make measurement imperative. The more obvious need is for inputs to future strategy decisions, which will allow for improvement with each campaign cycle based on what worked best in previous cycles. Less obvious but just as important is the need to demonstrate the marketing department&rsquo;s contribution to the success of the organization.</p>

<p class="tx">But can marketing&rsquo;s impact be measured? If so, with what precision?</p>

<a id="p62"></a>
<p class="tx">The standard measure of organizational success used by financial managers is the calculation of <strong>return on investment (ROI)</strong>. This measure is a ratio that compares the money gained or lost on an investment relative to the amount of money invested. In the marketing process, the goal of step 5 is to measure the money generated in sales (or other desired gain, such as an increase in brand awareness or ability to recall a product&rsquo;s benefits) relative to the amount of money invested in the campaign. Marketers have begun calling this measure <strong>return on marketing investment (ROMI)</strong>.</p>

<p class="tx">Ideally, every marketing strategy is measured, with information about its outcome feeding each subsequent round of strategic planning. Sadly, marketing measurement is often neglected. Measurement can be expensive. Some companies simply won&rsquo;t include a budget to pay for it in their marketing plans. Ad agencies tend not to emphasize measurement&mdash;it might shift budget dollars away from media buys or creative tasks&mdash;or worse, reveal that a campaign they created was not effective. And, compared to the work of developing strategies and creating advertising, measurement is simply not very exciting. When measurement takes place in today&rsquo;s business landscape, it is driven by the need to prove that what is paid for is performing up to expectations. The need to show ROMI drives measurement.</p>

<p class="tx">Government units typically require measurement of the marketing processes they engage in, because they must justify their budgets to comply with rigorous fiscal management and legislative oversight. The antismoking campaign example mentioned earlier included measures of effectiveness. Evaluation was planned into every aspect of the campaign&rsquo;s 3-year-long execution. The campaign, which encompassed advertising targeted to different populations, a teaching curriculum, and participatory youth events, was measured by monitoring the change in the number of new smokers among members of the target populations, based on the state&rsquo;s ongoing program to measure tobacco use. Execution and measurement were coordinated by the ad agency and paid for by the state of Wisconsin. In this case the outcome was positive: a decrease in new smokers each year of the program (Wisconsin Department of Health Services, 2018).</p>


<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.6.1">Plan Ahead for Measurement</h2>
<p class="tx">How a campaign is executed can build in means for measurement. One-to-one campaigns have the advantage of being highly measurable, unlike mass-market campaigns. The ease of quantifying campaign response is one reason marketers are using more one-to-one marketing. The data warehouse records the campaign information that went to the customer and captures the customer&rsquo;s subsequent behavior. If a variable-data-printed birthday health-screening reminder is followed by an appointment for a health screening, marketers can justifiably claim that their campaign caused that result. Measuring targeted or mass-media campaigns is more difficult, but it can be done if marketers plan ahead, although not with the same degree of specificity as one-to-one campaigns.</p>

<p class="tx">Marketing measurement tracks the behavior of groups of people over time. It requires comparison of a &ldquo;before&rdquo; state to an &ldquo;after&rdquo; state. Effective measurement also requires a test group and a control group&mdash;a population that receives the campaign message and a similar population unaware of the message. These pairs can be pulled from similar geographic areas or similar market segments, depending on the campaign strategy. Planning for measurement should include specifications for the time frame and the groups that will be measured for comparison.</p>

<a id="p63"></a>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec2.6.2">What to Measure?</h2>
<p class="tx">If the overall goal of this step is to measure the impact of a marketing strategy, what data points might provide insight into that impact?</p>

<p class="tx">To calculate ROI or ROMI, the key data are monetary amounts generated in sales relative to the monetary amount expended to conduct the marketing campaign. When the goal is something other than sales, such as an increase in brand awareness, measuring ROI/ROMI is much more difficult, as the monetary value of that intangible increase must be estimated.</p>

<p class="tx">Measuring campaign effectiveness is one means of assessing the impact of a marketing strategy. It, too, can be considered market research, although for very different purposes than research to select a strategy or provide evidence the strategy is sound.</p>

<p class="tx">Some data <em>directly</em> reflect measures of campaign effectiveness; other data <em>indirectly</em> reflect campaign effectiveness by looking to operational performance for evidence.</p>

<p class="tx">A direct measure of campaign effectiveness is the <strong>A/B split</strong>, a technique in which elements of a message are varied and tested one by one. The elements may be as subtle as two different headlines or as dramatic as two completely different value propositions. The message being tested can be a print ad, a web page, a social media post, an e-mail message&mdash;the technique works regardless of the form the message takes.</p>

<p class="tx">The A/B split technique was used by a health care device manufacturer to test two pitches for a medical ventilator (a device to help patients breathe). One message promised a nurse&rsquo;s advocate would be available around the clock to answer questions on the ventilator&rsquo;s use. The other message omitted any mention of the nurse&rsquo;s advocate but otherwise conveyed the same value proposition. The ad promising the nurse&rsquo;s advocate pulled much better response in preliminary tests, convincing the company that the cost of adding a nurse to the staff would be recouped in sales (Olderman, 2011).</p>

<div class="box-2">

</div>

<a id="p64"></a>
<p class="tx">The A/B split advertising measurement method has been in use for decades and continues to be a reliable method for improving campaign response. <em>Field Trip 2.5</em> gives an example from Gallup &amp; Robinson, an advertising and marketing research firm.</p>

<p class="tx">Indirect measures of campaign effectiveness rely on counting the sales generated by the campaign, using operational data. The marketing department needs reports that track</p>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">sales volume,</li>
<li class="bl">repeat purchases,</li>
<li class="bl">new customer activity,</li>
<li class="bl">purchases by specific market segments,</li>
<li class="bl">purchases in specific geographic areas,</li>
<li class="bl">change in order sizes, and/or</li>
<li class="bl">source of new sales (to measure message channel effectiveness).</li>
</ul>

<p class="tx">When marketing campaigns include an offer that is specific to the campaign and make a unique and trackable call to action, measurement is relatively straightforward. Consider, for example, a radio commercial for Acme&rsquo;s thingamajigs that announces &ldquo;20% off all orders received by June 1&rdquo; paired with the call to action, &ldquo;Mention WGN Radio to receive your discount when you call.&rdquo; Each caller who mentions WGN when placing an order can be counted as a campaign response.</p>

<p class="tx">It is more difficult to measure the effect of marketing that does not make a specific call to action, because the effects are slower to accumulate and rarely can be directly attributed to specific campaign elements. The effect of image advertising, sponsorships, and other public relations efforts are hard to track. Even so, research with a sample of members of the target population can reveal changes in their ability to recall brand attributes or specific product benefits. Presumably, an increase in recall of positive attributes can be claimed as a &ldquo;win&rdquo; for the marketing strategy, just as tangible sales results can.</p>

<p class="tx">Measuring the results of marketing processes is critical for two reasons:</p>

<ol class="nl">
<li class="nl">	to provide feedback on marketing strategy and execution, to improve with the next cycle of the marketing process; and</li>
<li class="nl">	to prove the marketing department&rsquo;s contribution to the success of the organization, to ensure operational and financial support.</li>
</ol>

<p class="tx">We&rsquo;ve now discussed each of the five steps in the marketing process, from situation analysis through measurement.</p>

<div class="box-1">
<h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
<p class="tx">Returning once more to the frozen dinner business niche, consider the hypothetical business you described in response to the questions at the end of Section 2.4. You were asked what blend of mass-market, targeted, or one-to-one message channels would be most effective in reaching your target customers. Now consider measurement of that campaign. What measures might allow you to compare the performance of those channels against each other?</p>

<h2 class="Case-Study h2" id="ch02casestudy"><strong>Case Study: </strong><em>Love at First Taste</em></h2> 

<p class="tx">Look in your cupboard&mdash;do you have a package of Knorr soup, a stock cube, or maybe a sauce mix? Knorr is Unilever&rsquo;s largest food brand. At 178 years old, its products aren&rsquo;t exactly identified with youth. When the brand&rsquo;s managers decided on a strategic objective of repositioning Knorr to attract millennials, it was time to put the marketing process in gear. </p>

<p class="tx"><em>Analysis:</em> Initial analysis brought to light that millennial consumer behavior is decidedly food-forward. A Mintel market research study found that over 60% of millennials identify as &ldquo;foodies&rdquo; (34% for all ages). They spend 14 times as much on food as the average person. Nearly 90% say that even when money is tight, they splurge on food (Morgan, 2017). </p>

<p class="tx">All Knorr needed to do to promote its convenience-oriented product line (skillet meals, soups, side dishes, and sauce and stock mixes) to millennials was to draw their attention to the brand. Unilever engaged advertising agency MullenLowe London. Rebecca Morgan, chief strategy officer,&nbsp;described the campaign for Knorr, called Love at First Taste, in a case study published on CampaignLive. In that report, she described millennials&rsquo; use of food for expression and as a status symbol&mdash;for example, posting photos of food to Instagram. But millennials are also known for &ldquo;questioning everything that the established food brands were offering,&rdquo; Morgan wrote. &ldquo;It had become increasingly difficult to drive equity and penetration among the new generation of foodies&rdquo; (Morgan, 2017, para. 6).</p>

<p class="tx">Knorr conducted its own consumer background research, asking 12,000 people in 12 countries about what flavor meant to them. &ldquo;One of the key findings of Knorr&rsquo;s research was that three in four people (over 78% in fact) are more likely to be attracted to someone who enjoys the same flavors&rdquo; (Unilever, 2016, para. 7), according to a press release on the Unilever website. </p>

<p class="tx">That research held the clue that would lead MullenLowe&rsquo;s creative team to the campaign strategy Knorr selected for execution.</p>

<p class="tx"><em>Marketing strategy:</em> MullenLowe&rsquo;s millennial campaign targeted three objectives. </p>

<ol class="nl">
<li class="nl">	Connect emotionally (rather than focus on the product, as Knorr had done in the&nbsp;past). </li>
<li class="nl">	Increase brand equity, as measured by recommendation, differentiation, and market&nbsp;share. </li>
<li class="nl">	Get them talking about Knorr, as measured by online mentions. </li>
</ol>

<p class="tx">What strategy would they use to attain those objectives? &ldquo;We found our idea on the dating sites and we are not ashamed to admit it,&rdquo; Morgan (2017, para. 20) wrote. The advertising agency planned to link flavor, personality, and love to get millennials talking about Knorr. This led to a two-part strategy: Develop the Flavor Profiler, an online quiz, and conduct a social experiment and film it, resulting in a video. Both components would be highly sharable on social media. The intent of the two components was to build an &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; that would earn free exposure. </p>

<p class="tx"><em>Campaign development:</em> The campaign was given the name Love at First Taste. Knorr built the Flavor Profiler using artificial intelligence technology to classify site visitors as one of 12 flavor personality types. To create the video content, Knorr conducted a social experiment, pairing strangers (millennials, of course) for a first date. The couples were matched using the Knorr Flavor Profiler. The intent of the research was to see if shared food preferences could &ldquo;create chemistry between the couples&rdquo; (Unilever, 2016, para. 8). After meeting each other before the cameras, the couples were given a surprising instruction&mdash;they would have to feed each other the entire meal set before them. The awkward and often amusing results of the experiment were captured in Knorr&rsquo;s <em>Love at First Taste</em> video. Additional content was generated with a <em>Behind the Scenes</em> video and updates as the participating couples produced video &ldquo;date diaries.&rdquo; </p>

<a id="p66"></a>
<p class="tx"><em>Execution:</em> Knorr used YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter to drive conversations and shares that would bring consumers to the Flavor Profiler on the Knorr website. People who completed the quiz would receive recipe recommendations tailored to their flavor profile. First, the campaign was rolled out to social media influencers via a sneak preview with exclusive content. Then, the content was launched via social media. </p>

<p class="tx"><em>Measurement:</em> Social media benchmarks were tracked, including average completion rate, average click-through rate, and average share rate. The campaign garnered 2.5 earned (free) impressions for every paid ad impression. (The distinction between earned and paid media is discussed in Chapter 6.) <em>Love at First Taste</em> became the most-chosen-to-watch video on YouTube in May 2016 and second-most-viewed YouTube video ad that year. Over 1.2 million people used the Profiler worldwide, &ldquo;meaning voluntary exposure to the brand,&rdquo; said Morgan (2017, para. 30). The campaign won a Gold award in Effective Content Strategies at the 2017 World Advertising Research Center Awards (World Advertising Research Center, 2017). In 2016 it won a Silver award in the Effies, a worldwide competition to honor the most effective marketing communications ideas, in the categories of Brand Experience and Food (Oakes,&nbsp;2017). </p>

<h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Challenge Question</strong></h1>
<p class="tx">In Chapter 1 you were asked to pick a product that interests you or use the examples of quinoa or craft beer presented in that chapter. You described that product by analyzing the CVE it offers in terms of the four utilities of customer value: form, time, place, and ease of possession.</p>

<p class="tx">Now consider how the marketing process might be applied to promotion of that product. What does situation analysis reveal about unmet customer needs? In terms of marketing strategy, what might your marketing mix be? What market research might be needed to help you choose a target market and develop a value proposition? How might you develop, execute, and measure a campaign promoting that product?</p>

<h2 class="eoc-h2" id="ch02keyideas">Key Ideas to Remember</h2>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">Marketing takes place in the context of macro marketing, company strategy, and marketing department operations. Decision support tools like the BCG Matrix and Ansoff&rsquo;s Matrix help marketers design the business portfolio and select growth strategies for strategic business units. Marketing supports the company&rsquo;s overarching objectives as defined in its strategic plan.</li>
<li class="bl">The marketing process consists of situation analysis, selection of a marketing strategy, and development of campaign strategy, followed by execution and measurement. This process fits into the larger picture of business operations by connecting consumers and producers of the business&rsquo;s products and services. </li>
<li class="bl">Marketers conduct research to provide the specific information necessary to make marketing strategy decisions. Research helps marketers to discover opportunities, learn about market segments, make decisions, and measure the impact of campaign executions. The result of the marketing strategy step is selection of a market segment to target and a value proposition to appeal to that segment.</li>
<li class="bl">To develop campaigns, marketers apply decisions about the marketing mix, select a strategy regarding message channels, and develop creative messages to convey an underlying value proposition. The fast growth in one-to-one marketing made possible by increasing computing power now requires planning for multiple message channels, including those driven by databases of customer and prospect information.</li>
<li class="bl">Execution of a marketing campaign requires preparing a media plan specifying what message channels will be used; developing creative messages (including systems for one-to-one marketing) to fill the message channels; monitoring that the messages stay aligned with strategy and get delivered according to plan; and finally, making adjustments to parts of the campaign, if needed.</li>
<li class="bl">Measuring the results of marketing processes provides information to improve subsequent campaigns, plus evidence of the marketing department&rsquo;s contribution to the success of the organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="eoc-h2" id="ch02criticalthinking">Critical-Thinking Questions</h2>

<ol class="nl">
<li class="nl">	Do you think marketing strategy should drive the rest of a company&rsquo;s operations or not? Support your position.</li>
<li class="nl">	Describe your cell phone in terms of the benefits it delivers. Assume you are the target market for a new upgraded phone from the same company. Write three survey questions that could help you test what new features should be included in the upgrade, based on the benefits you&rsquo;ve identified.</li>
<li class="nl">	Take the upgraded cell phone product from the previous question and decide whether it is best suited to a mass-market campaign, targeted message channels, or one-to-one marketing. Give the reasons for your decision.</li>
<li class="nl">	You are a marketer for a large shoe retailer. You have a database that includes information about customers&rsquo; past purchases&mdash;date of purchase, style, size, and price point, as well as e-mail addresses and opt-in permission to receive marketing messages. Describe the steps involved in executing a marketing campaign triggered by customer data using one-to-one messaging.</li>
<li class="nl">	You&rsquo;ve learned that reasons for measuring the marketing process include providing feedback on marketing strategy and execution to improve the marketing process and proving the marketing department&rsquo;s contribution to the success of the business. Is one of the reasons for measuring results more important than the other? Why?</li>
