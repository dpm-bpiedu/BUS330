<h1 class="h1" id="ch03intro">Introduction</h1>

<p class="tx">This chapter examines the history of jails and explores their common purposes and functions. We begin our investigation by defining what a jail is. We then explore the historical antecedents to the modern jail, focusing on the origin and development of jails in American society. We explore the role of the jail in 19th-century America, discuss the 20th-century jail, examine pretrial detention and the jailing process (&ldquo;rabble management&rdquo;), and review some modern jail management concerns, including jail conditions, jail design, and the problem of mentally ill inmates. Over time jails have evolved; they have served a specific role in society, but this traditional purpose is being questioned in the 21st century. </p>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec3.1">3.1&ensp;Jails: Basic Facts and Figures</h1>

<p class="tx">Jails are designed to temporarily house two types of people: <strong>pretrial detainees</strong> and <strong>sentenced offenders</strong>. Pretrial detainees are awaiting a criminal trial and have not been convicted; sentenced offenders, meanwhile, have been sentenced to time in jail (usually for less than 1 year) as a punishment.</p>

<p class="tx">Jails come in different sizes, depending on the size of the jurisdiction, and they fluctuate in population, depending on the number of arrests and nature of the offenses (see Table 3.1). Small jails might have capacity for fewer than 100 inmates, while large jails can house 250 inmates or more. As of the end of 2016, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (Zeng, 2018) reported that there were 704,501 inmates being held in jails across the United States. On any given day, a single jail may house thousands of inmates, such as the Los Angeles County Jail or Rikers Island in New York City, which together house over 33,000 prisoners.</p>

<div class="p-ct">Jail cells are very basic accommodations, since they are only designed to detain inmates for a short time. How might jail cells differ from prison cells?</div>
</div>
<p class="tx">The number of inmates held in jails remained stable between 2011 and 2016 (Zeng, 2018). Approximately 80% of jails were at 80% capacity in 2016, while 17% of jails were operating at full or above full capacity. While this may seem high, consider that in the 1990s and early 2000s, jails averaged close to 100% and 92% capacity, respectively (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1995). Overall, these changes indicate a significant drop in the jail population over time.</p>

<p class="tx">Much of the change in jail population capacity can be attributed to communities building more jail space during the latter part of the 20th century, thereby accommodating more inmates. As a community&rsquo;s response to crime changes, the size of the prisoner population will change accordingly. Communities vary in how they respond to crime; hence, different communities will have different jail populations, both in terms of type and number of prisoners (Klofas, 1990). More importantly, many communities have built regional jails to share the costs associated with housing jailed prisoners (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2011b). Overall there has been a decrease in the number of jail facilities in the United States, from 3,376 facilities in 1999 to 3,283 facilities in 2006 (Stephan &amp; Walsh, 2011). There has also been a change in the primary use of jails as holding tanks for the impoverished, disenfranchised, and mentally ill. Increasingly, communities are embracing the idea that jails can be more than just warehouses&mdash;they can be places of treatment and crisis intervention, where the cycle of criminality can be broken (Stinchcomb, 2011). This latter ambition is a tall order for jails, since they have typically served a warehousing purpose for much of their history. Only time will tell if the contemporary jail is able to move beyond its basic custodial mission. To better understand this past, we now turn to the subject of jail history.</p>

<h1 class="h1" id="sec3.2">3.2&ensp;Historical Foundations of the Jail</h1>

<div class="photo-right">
<img id="img3.2" class="scaled" alt="Image of the Walnut Street Jail." title="Image of the Walnut Street Jail." src="images/3.2.jpg" />
<p class="credit">Encyclopaedia Britannica/Universal Images Group/Getty Images</p>
<div class="p-ct">The Walnut Street Jail was the first jail in the United States.</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">The <strong>Walnut Street Jail</strong>, built in 1790 in Philadelphia, is typically regarded as America&rsquo;s first local jail (Rothman &amp; Morris, 1997). While other institutions existed prior to the establishment of the Walnut Street Jail, it was the first jail to be used for correction and punishment. The jail represented a radical change from commonly accepted methods of dealing with social outcasts, deviants, the poor, or mentally ill. The Walnut Street Jail was built around the time that institutionalization was beginning to gain ground in the United States (the early 19th century), when methods outside of the home came to be viewed as more effective for addressing common social ills, such as crime, poverty, and mental illness (Rothman, 1971).</p>

<h2 class="h2">The Jacksonian Era: 1820&ndash;1850</h2>
<p class="tx">Reformers who espoused institutionalization were known as the <em>Jacksonians</em>. They represented what is referred to as the <strong>Jacksonian era</strong> in American history, a period firmly entrenched in the belief that institutions of confinement were the solution to the 19th century&rsquo;s growing crime and deviancy problems (Rothman, 1980). These reformers paved the way for the development of the jail and other institutions of confinement. Their views were shaped by the fact that cities were growing at a rate faster than communities were able to handle, and the attendant problems could not be addressed by employing traditional methods of social control. Thus, the jail, along with prisons later in the 19th century, served as a new and radical way to deal with social problems.</p>

<p class="tx">These institutions were intended to be places where criminals, deviants, vagrants, and the mentally ill could be housed and dealt with outside of the community. In this way, the jailed social outcast was &ldquo;out of sight and mind&rdquo; for most people. The growth and acceptance of institutionalization became widely recognized as a progressive way to deal with society&rsquo;s most problematic individuals, such as the mentally ill, the sick and neglected, the poor, or criminal offenders. As a result, jails became part of a network of institutions that proliferated throughout the early 19th century. These institutions of confinement were a reaction to the cruelty and barbarousness of earlier methods of social control, such as corporal and capital punishment, and were viewed as humane alternatives to the more draconian methods of dealing with deviants.</p>

<p class="tx">In fact, Goldfarb (1975) has suggested that the creation of the early jail, specifically the Walnut Street Jail, was directly related to what early religious reformers&mdash;the Quakers&mdash;viewed as outrageous and cruel ways to deal with the poor, the ill, and the criminal. Institutionalizing such people in jails and prisons was viewed as more humane. As Rothman (1971) has stated, however, this justification became part of the repertoire of those who favored institutionalization. Somewhat ironically, in promoting institutionalization as a method of social control, reformers argued that their intent was to avoid reverting to cruel and inhumane practices. Thus, the history of cruelty and violence against the weakest elements in society fostered a belief in the idea that institutionalization was the only civilized way to deal with them. As a result, jails continued to proliferate throughout 19th-century America.</p>

<a id="p57"></a>

<p class="tx">However, did jail systems really offer a humane alternative to the lash or the hangman&rsquo;s noose? Some social historians have suggested that the cruelty associated with corporal and capital punishments became embedded in jails and prisons (Rothman, 1971). In other words, while institutions may have moved away from physically punishing criminal offenders, a newer form of brutality emerged in jails. In fact, jails have historically represented a type of punishment and confinement that is quite distinct from other confinement institutions. As Goldfarb (1975) states, &ldquo;There was no coherent architectural history or planning of the jail institution; nor has there been much variation in the function and design of the jail to the present time&rdquo; (p. 10). In short, the jail was viewed as a holding tank; nothing more, nothing less. Jails were built with the sole intention of housing people who could not be handled in any other way. Later sections of this chapter explore how 20th-century jail architecture changed the nature of the jail.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Jails From 1850&ndash;1900</h2>
<p class="tx">The jail was useful to urban America&rsquo;s growing cities, where the socially deviant or the poor could be controlled simply by warehousing them. The jail also helped control many criminal gangs that increasingly roamed the western United States. To address the growing lawlessness, more and more communities began to build jails. Many of these were no more than makeshift structures intended to house criminals for very short periods of time.</p>

<p class="tx">By the end of the 19th century, most American cities and counties had established jails. The sheriff was in charge of the jail, which remains the case in most counties today. The jail became more critical to communities when crime proliferated and urban centers expanded. As community populations grew, so too did jail populations. Managing these offenders became the jail&rsquo;s central purpose (Irwin, 1985).</p>

<h2 class="h2">The 20th-Century Jail</h2>
<p class="tx">As the 20th century progressed, jails increasingly focused on <strong>rabble management</strong>, which describes the process of warehousing offenders who threaten the social order largely due to the offensiveness of their behavior, rather than their abject criminality. &ldquo;Rabble management&rdquo; is not exclusive to jails. The entire criminal justice system, beginning with police, serves to control those whom society finds offensive. The rabble class poses many problems (vandalism, loitering, littering, inappropriate public behavior, etc.); hence, maintaining order in the community and minimizing &ldquo;broken windows&rdquo; (Kelling &amp; Wilson, 1982; Kelling &amp; Coles, 1996) is a key function of the police. In this way rabble management is consistent with the broader goals of maintaining community order.</p>

<a id="p58"></a>

<div class="photo-box-left-thin">

<p class="credit">Mandel Ngan/&copy;2012 AFP/Getty Images</p>
<div class="p-ct">People who are offensive to society are referred to as &ldquo;rabble.&rdquo; Do you think such people deserve to be arrested and put in jail? Why or why not?</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">Irwin (1985) defines rabble as those &ldquo;mostly detached and disreputable persons who are arrested more because they are offensive than because they have committed crimes&rdquo; (p. xiii). The rabble class is composed of individuals who might be described as public nuisances: the derelicts, the drunks, the vagrants, the mentally ill, and the homeless. Thus, rabble management involves removing from city streets those individuals who are offensive yet perhaps not necessarily dangerous upon closer examination of their crimes.</p>

<p class="tx">In the 20th century those rounded up as part of rabble management were headed for a brief stint in the county jail. This is how the jail came to serve its primary function of controlling those who are the most socially offensive yet actually pose very little threat to society. Moreover, since jails are primarily composed of &ldquo;rabble,&rdquo; their conditions have typically been poor. In fact, jail is often considered the worst place to be confined, even worse than prison, although those in jail have committed relatively less serious crimes. A majority of people in jail are pretrial detainees who are awaiting trial and have not been determined guilty of a crime. Ironically, they are forced to live in conditions much worse than those found in many state prisons, where convicted felons are sent. </p>

<p class="tx">Irwin (1985) argued that in the 20th century, American jails evolved to become institutions of social control for not only the most offensive but also those who make up the underclass&mdash;the people who have the least social power and are the most accepting of jail life. These include petty hustlers, derelicts, junkies, &ldquo;crazies,&rdquo; and outlaws&mdash;many of whom have had previous experiences with the criminal justice system and are considered &ldquo;disreputable&rdquo; by the general public. These factors led Irwin (1985) to suggest that <em>offensiveness</em> is the critical variable in jail inmates&rsquo; crimes and the reason why jails are filled with those who are the least powerful in society.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Who Makes Up Those in Jail?</h2>
<p class="tx">Recent demographic profiles of jail inmates support the claim that jails do in fact house the most marginalized and disenfranchised members of society. For example, data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (Zeng, 2018) indicate that in 2016 non-Hispanic Blacks were incarcerated at 3.5 times the rate of non-Hispanic Whites; in 2000 non-Hispanic Blacks were incarcerated at almost 6 times the rate of non-Hispanic Whites. These figures indicate disparity among different members of society. </p>

<a id="p59"></a>

<p class="tx">Then, couple this information with prearrest income data and other relevant socioeconomic indicators. According to Rabuy and Kopf (2015), in 2014 the median annual income for male jail inmates prior to their arrest was $19,650. In comparison, nonincarcerated individuals&rsquo; median income was more than double that ($41,250). In addition, a majority of jail inmates had never married prior to arrest (57.6%); just under 54% had not completed high school (Bronson &amp; Berzofsky, 2017); and 29% were unemployed (James, 2004). Interestingly, jail inmates also have long records of illegal drug usage, with nearly 69% using drugs regularly prior to incarceration (James, 2004). Clearly, then, it seems that a sizable number of jail inmates are from what would be called the underclass&mdash;those members of society who are the most disenfranchised and alienated from conventional norms and values. </p>

<p class="tx">Equally devastating is the fact that many jail inmates suffer from some type of mental illness. According to Bronson and Berzofsky (2017), from 2011 to 2012, 14% of state and federal prisoners and 26% of jail inmates reported having experiences that met the threshold for serious psychological distress. In another examination of five jails over two time periods, however, Steadman, Osher, Robbins, Case, &amp; Samuels (2009) found severe mental illness to be much lower: 14.5% for male prisoners and over 31% for female prisoners. While the research findings vary across studies, the data does not paint a rosy picture about the composition of offenders in jail. It is clear that jails house those who are poor and suffer from many problems related to substance abuse and mental illness.</p>



<div class="box-2">
<h1 class="h1"><strong>Applying Criminal Justice:</strong> <em>How to Define the &ldquo;Rabble Class&rdquo;</em></h1>

<p class="tx">This chapter introduced the concept of &ldquo;rabble&rdquo; to discuss who is confined in jails, defining the rabble class as being composed of petty offenders, the homeless, the poor, and the mentally ill. This definition is problematic, however. Obviously, not everyone in jail fits this description. Jails also house more affluent and socially stable people who have been arrested, say, for public intoxication or drunk driving. Are such people part of the rabble class? Should they be treated differently?</p>

<p class="tx">Is Irwin correct to say that &ldquo;rabble&rdquo; is a social status defined by an offender&rsquo;s degree of social offensiveness, rather than criminal seriousness? Can the jail escape its history of rabble management&mdash;and if so, how? What would you do to change or move away from the notion of jail as a place to manage society&rsquo;s rabble? Is such a move possible or even desirable? As you read subsequent chapters, think about the concept of rabble management in jails and how the rest of the corrections process is affected by such a characterization.</p>

<h1 class="h1" id="sec3.3">3.3&ensp;Contemporary Jail Management Issues</h1>

<p class="tx">The jail of the past was a product of a number of forces. This remains the case today, though contemporary jails experience new issues that require the attention of jail managers. This section explores the conditions in jails and the three types of jail design. </p>

<h2 class="h2">Conditions in Jail</h2>
<p class="tx">The conditions of most contemporary American jails are quite poor; despite many cities&rsquo; attempts to improve conditions, many jails, on the whole, are terrible places to be. In the 1980s, according to the National Institute of Justice (1988), jail managers cited conditions as a major area of concern and identified six major areas that required immediate attention. Figure 3.1 shows the percentage of jail managers who indicated a specific area was problematic; note that many of these issues persist today.</p>

<a id="p60"></a>

<div class="figure-box">
<h4 class="figure-name">Figure 3.1: Jail facility needs</h4>

<p class="tx">Jail managers are faced with many issues; finding adequate space to house inmates is chief among the most pressing problems.</p>

<img src="figures/fig_3.1.jpg" alt="Bar graph depicting pressing needs of jail facilities and percentage of facilities needing them: 74% need space for separation in housing; 72% need program space; 65% need surveillance of jails; 61% need booking-intake space; 54% need room for lawyers and visitors; and 50% need audiovisual surveillance equipment." title="Bar graph depicting pressing needs of jail facilities and percentage of facilities needing them: 74% need space for separation in housing; 72% need program space; 65% need surveillance of jails; 61% need booking-intake space; 54% need room for lawyers and visitors; and 50% need audiovisual surveillance equipment." class="figure" id="fig_3.1" />
<p class="credit_left">From <span class="no-ital">Nation&rsquo;s Jail Managers Assess Their Problems</span>, by Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1998, Washington, DC: US Department of&nbsp;Justice.</p>
</div>

<p class="tx">The major problematic areas are space for separation in housing (74%), program space (72%), and surveillance of jail cells (65%). It is well known that many jails lack the space to adequately house their number of inmates. This problem becomes compounded by the poor quality of food, unsafe living conditions, and an indifferent correctional officer staff. Given these conditions, it seems clear why many argue that jails are the nation&rsquo;s worst institution, and why Goldfarb (1975) felt compelled to describe them as the &ldquo;nation&rsquo;s dumping ground&rdquo; (p. 2).</p>

</div>

<p class="tx">Recently, many jail administrators have called for more resources and attention to be given to the country&rsquo;s ailing and outdated jails. This thinking has spawned interest in designing jails so as to make them more manageable. Jail management and design became a very important matter in the 1990s and remain significant in the 21st century. Many cities, particularly large urban centers, have invested huge sums in constructing new jail facilities or have collaborated with other communities to build regional jails. Jail managers and those interested in jail reform regard these as important investments. </p>

<h2 class="h2">Jail Design and Management</h2>
<p class="tx">Jail management and design has captured the attention of many interested in corrections. U.S. jails have featured three categories of jail architecture over the past 200 years (Nelson, 1986). Each differs in structure; in addition, each proposes a different philosophy and management approach to the jail&rsquo;s operation.</p>


<h3 class="h3">Linear/Intermittent Surveillance</h3>
<p class="tx">The <strong>linear/intermittent surveillance</strong> jail design, illustrated in Figure 3.2, features an architectural style that is linear or at right angles to the surveillance area. The structural design and management philosophy emphasize limited interactions between inmates and correctional officers&mdash;hence the name &ldquo;intermittent surveillance.&rdquo; Central to this approach is the belief that the relationship between correctional officers and prisoners should be minimal; at best, interaction only occurs when officers conduct counts.</p>



<div class="figure-box">
<h4 class="figure-name">Figure 3.2: The linear/intermittent surveillance jail design</h4>

<p class="tx">The linear/intermittent jail design emphasizes limited interaction between inmates and officers.</p>

<p class="credit_left">Adapted from &ldquo;Changing Concepts in Jail Design and Management,&rdquo; by W. R. Nelson, in D.B. Kalinich and J. Klofas (Eds.),<span class="no-ital"> Sneaking Inmates Down the Alley: Problems and Prospects in Jail Management</span> (p. 169), 1986, Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas.</p>
</div>

<a id="p62"></a>

<p class="tx">This traditional approach to jail design and management sought to isolate the inmate from the correctional staff. Remember that jails were historically viewed as holding tanks that expected minimal interaction between inmate and custodian. In fact, many contemporary writers believe that a number of the problems associated with jails can be traced to their rather antiquated design and management (Kerle, 2003). However, this is less the case today. Newer approaches to jail design aim to help correctional officers more effectively supervise prisoners.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Podular/Remote Surveillance</h3>

<p class="tx">The <strong>podular/remote surveillance</strong> design requires that correctional officers have no direct interaction with jailed prisoners (see Figure 3.3). In this design, officers monitor inmates from a pod within the housing unit which, in most jails, gives them a 360-degree view of the cell block. Officers do not interact with inmates directly, except when responding to requests for services or to leave the housing unit. This approach to jail design and management has been described as &ldquo;second generation&rdquo; because it is viewed as the next alternative to the more traditional &ldquo;first generation&rdquo; linear/intermittent surveillance design. The podular/remote surveillance management philosophy is reactive in that it assumes that inmates will act in a violent or unpredictable manner. Thus, the officer is separated from the inmate through the podular design; if trouble occurs in the housing unit, the officer is protected by a fixture, and more officers can be summoned in an emergency.</p>

<div class="figure-box">
<h4 class="figure-name">Figure 3.3: The podular/remote surveillance jail design</h4>

<p class="tx">Also known as the &ldquo;second generation&rdquo; jail, the podular/remote design acknowledges that some interaction between inmates and officers, albeit limited, is required.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Podular/Direct Supervision</h3>

<p class="tx">The final type of jail design, shown in Figure 3.4, is known as the <strong>podular/direct supervision</strong> approach. Under this design, inmate and officer are placed in the same housing unit with no structural separations. This design has its origin in the &ldquo;functional unit&rdquo; concept developed for federal institutions in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Its fundamental premise was to have inmates occupy single cells in a self-contained area that was under the direct supervision of staff. The idea quickly spread to other institutions and was the operating principle behind the construction of federal Metropolitan Correctional Centers built in the mid-1970s (Zupan, 1991).</p>

<div class="p-ct">The Progressive period focused on rehabilitation, such as teaching skills inmates could use upon integration back into society. Do you think this sort of program is beneficial or too lenient? Not all jails require prisoners to interact with correctional officers. Some officers simply observe inmates using computers and video cameras. Do you think this system is more or less effective than others discussed?</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">In the podular/direct supervision approach, the housing unit contains up to 50 cells, each of which is occupied by one inmate. Unlike the other two approaches, this model attempts to be proactive in its management philosophy, relying on officers&rsquo; skills and training to control 
and supervise inmates. Therefore, this approach requires correctional officers to be properly trained.</p>

<p class="tx">Given this, many have argued that the podular/direct supervision model is only as good as the staff that is implementing it. In short, correctional officers are at the core of this type of jail design and management. Improperly trained officers would be unable to achieve the conditions expected of this contemporary jail, such as enhanced safety for inmates and officers. While the linear/intermittent and podular/remote models are reactive and only minimally involve the correctional officer, the podular/direct model makes officers the cornerstone of effective jail management and directly involves them in maintaining control and security. As some have suggested, the new generation philosophy makes the correctional officer&rsquo;s role more rewarding (Klofas, Smith, &amp; Meister,&nbsp;1986).</p>

<h3 class="h3">Direct Supervision Principles</h3>

<p class="tx">Most importantly, as stated by Nelson (1986), the new generation design enables managers and administrators to overcome many of the jail&rsquo;s classic problems. Institutions that employ the direct supervision model subscribe to eight general principles of operation: safety, control, communications, supervision, manageability, classification, just treatment, and effective personnel. By providing better jail design and management, contemporary jails can become more than the neglected institutions they have been in the past. </p>

<p class="tx">In fact, research by the National Institute of Corrections (1987) has shown the benefits of the new generation concept of jail management. In its examination of the Manhattan House of Detention, the institute found that assaults, violence, and the physical destruction of property were all reduced under the new feneration philosophy when compared to the traditional design and management approach. Other research has also indicated that correctional officers are supportive of the podular/direct supervision concept once they experience the visible changes the model brings to the jail (Lovrich &amp; Zupan, 1987; Wener, 2006). </p>

<p class="tx">The National Institute of Corrections (2010) stresses that direct supervision principles are very important to the effective operation of modern jail facilities. These principles emphasize effective prisoner control, effective supervision, competent staff, safety of staff and inmates, manageable and cost-effective operations, effective communication, classification and orientation, and justice and fairness in operations. O&rsquo;Toole, Nelson, Liebert, and Keller (2004) offer an outcomes-based assessment strategy for jails seeking to evaluate the effectiveness of their direct supervision operations. Typical outcomes include lower levels of vandalism, graffiti, assault, dangerous contraband, and suicide among inmates and increased safety for both inmates and staff. </p>

</div>
<p class="tx"><strong>Pretrial detention</strong> is a mechanism whereby the court ensures a defendant remains in its custody until trial. </p>

<p class="tx">Pretrial detainees bring a specific set of challenges for jails. For example, their legal standing compared to convicted and sentenced prisoners can be complicated. Consider that one of the most controversial issues in jails is strip searches of pretrial detainees. In <em>Florence v. Board of </em><em>Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington et al.</em> (2012), the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of a lower court to allow pretrial detainees to be subjected to invasive strip searches. The court ruled that the institution&rsquo;s need for safety and security, especially regarding smuggled contraband, took precedence over an individual&rsquo;s right to privacy. The rights of both legally convicted offenders and those awaiting trial are examined in Chapter 5.</p>

<p class="tx">Another problematic issue is that of preventive detention and bail. Since the landmark case of <em>United States v. Salerno</em> (1987), the Supreme Court has upheld the legality of detaining someone prior to trial if he or she poses a threat to society. This preventive detention justification changed the nature of bail. Prior to the <em>Salerno</em> decision, bail was used to guarantee a defendant&rsquo;s appearance at a trial. Under <em>Salerno</em>, the court expanded the options available to courts and prosecutors to guarantee appearance and promote public safety. The United States has had a long history of reforming bail procedures in an attempt to make the criminal justice process more fair. The results of many efforts, such as the 1984 Federal Bail Reform Act, were either positive or negative, depending on one&rsquo;s point of view. Walker (2011) argues that bail reform efforts allowed many less serious offenders who posed no aggregate threat to the community to be released from jail prior to trial. However, there have always been isolated incidents in which a person on bail committed a particularly serious and heinous crime.</p>

<p class="tx">These issues highlight the various processes that affect jails and the offenders housed in them. No two offenders are alike; all offenders have different backgrounds and experiences with the criminal justice system. Most importantly, no two people respond to the jail experience in the exact same way. Irwin (1985) has written about the problems that inmates experience once incarcerated in jail. These problems center on four distinct processes: disintegration, disorientation, degradation, and preparation. Each process further removes an offender from the community and firmly entrenches him or her in the rabble lifestyle. As Irwin (1985) states:</p>

<p class="ext">Going to jail and being held there tends to maintain people in a rabble status or convert them to it. To maintain membership in conventional society and thereby avoid rabble status, a person must sustain a conscious commitment to a conventional set of social arrangements. When persons are arrested and jailed, their ties and arrangements with people outside very often disintegrate. In addition, they are profoundly disoriented and subjected to a series of degrading experiences that corrode their general commitment to society. Finally, they are prepared for rabble life by their experiences in jail, which supply them with the identity and culture required to get by as a disreputable.&nbsp;(p. 45)</p>

<p class="tx">Therefore, the jail serves to&mdash;albeit unintentionally&mdash;introduce inmates to a lifestyle that is antisocial and unconventional. This may be particularly true of pretrial detainees, who may become alienated from a system and society that treat them like criminals when they have not yet been found guilty of a crime. </p>

<p class="credit">Drew Nash/Times-News/Associated Press</p>
<div class="p-ct">Being separated from family is a major part of disintegration. Even though visitation is allowed, separation still exists due to the lack of privacy and intimacy during visits.</div>
</div>

<a id="p66"></a>

<h2 class="h2">Disintegration</h2>

<p class="tx">The <strong>disintegration</strong> process, by which the inmate loses all ties to the external world, involves three separate consequences (Irwin, 1985). The most tangible loss associated with being jailed is that of property, such as clothing, cars, and all other personal items. Often an inmate is unsure of when, or even if, he or she will get these items back. Losing personal property marks the beginning of the disintegration process and signifies to the inmate that he or she is no longer a member of the free community.</p>

<p class="tx">A second serious deprivation for many inmates is their loss of social ties to the outside world. While inmates are allowed to make a certain number of phone calls a day, this does not adequately replace or even serve to maintain relationships with loved ones on the outside. Being cut off from friends and loved ones is to be expected in jail, but the experience is made worse by very limited communication with the outside world. The disintegration process is accelerated when the inmate has no one to communicate with. Communication tends to center on the jail &ldquo;grapevine,&rdquo; but this does not meet the inmate&rsquo;s social needs. </p>

<p class="tx">Finally, one loses the &ldquo;capacity to take care of business&rdquo; (Irwin, 1985, p. 51) when incarcerated. The inability to effectively manage one&rsquo;s life while behind bars can be devastating both for pretrial detainees and for jailed inmates. For a typical prisoner, the average stay in jail prior to trial is about 6 months (Kerle, 2003)&mdash;a significant loss of time. Pretrial detainees cannot defend themselves as well as if they were released on bail prior to their trial, and very few inmates or detainees are able to handle their legal affairs while incarcerated. Some, for example, may have holds or detainers from other jurisdictions, and in many situations, being detained may prevent them from being able to resolve the pertinent issues involving these holds. As a result, they are further removed from the community, and the disintegration process continues. </p>

<a id="p67"></a>

<h2 class="h2">Disorientation</h2>
<p class="tx">The process of <strong>disorientation</strong>, by which the inmate loses his or her identity and sense of self, is underway throughout the entire jail experience. From arrest to booking to being placed in the jail&rsquo;s &ldquo;holding tank,&rdquo; disorientation occurs with such intensity that the inmate is rendered ill equipped to deal with the experience. This is particularly true among first-time offenders who are not experienced with jails. During this stage of the jailing process, the inmate becomes more conscious of the fact that he or she has been arrested and is incarcerated. In addition, the jail&rsquo;s typically poor conditions leave an indelible impression on the inmate.</p>

<p class="tx">Most importantly, the jail inmate becomes &ldquo;self-disorganized&rdquo; (Irwin, 1985, p. 63) to the point that he or she feels alienated and powerless. For first-time offenders, the jail experience warps their sense of the outside world and in some cases may introduce them to a rabble lifestyle that they permanently adopt. For most, however, the jail experience wears off upon release, although it is never fully forgotten. Moreover, for those who return to jail, the experience shapes their subsequent adjustment to jail and may &ldquo;propel them further outside&rdquo; (Irwin, 1985, p. 66) mainstream society.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Degradation</h2>
<p class="tx">Many have argued that doing time in jail is one of the most degrading experiences anyone can go through; far worse than being in prison (Rothman, 1971; Goldfarb, 1975). The <strong>degradation</strong> process, by which the inmate is demeaned, begins with arrest and culminates with the inmate&rsquo;s placement in jail. Along the way, the defendant must endure many humiliating experiences, most of which are tied to the jail&rsquo;s routine activities. This includes being strip-searched in the presence of other inmates and staff, insulted by police and deputy sheriffs who run the jail, and verbally harassed by other prisoners. </p>

<p class="tx">Jail staff aim to minimize these experiences, but this can be difficult for many reasons (Cornelius, 2008). For one, the culture of the jail and the staff who run it may normalize such behaviors or make them seem acceptable. For example, many deputy sheriffs view being assigned to work the jail as either a punishment for some wrongdoing on road patrol or as an initiation for rookie deputies, with the result that they may take their feelings out on the inmates. For most deputies, working in a jail is a temporary assignment, one which they do not initially choose. They are often placed there when they begin their law enforcement careers, and very few have an interest in working in the jail long-term (Kerle, 1998). More importantly, staff indifference toward inmates can be part of their adaptation to working in such an environment. By denying and degrading the inmate, the officer is reinforcing some of his or her own preconceived biases and stereotypes or finding a way to cope with the working environment. Even the most well-intentioned individual can become callous and indifferent to inmates&rsquo; needs, and in a surprisingly short amount of time. Yet this does not have to be the case. Much has been written on how jails can be run more professionally and become more positive working environments (Stinchcomb, Applegate, Kerle, &amp; Stojkovic, 2012).</p>

<h2 class="h2">Preparation</h2>
<p class="tx">After the inmate&rsquo;s ties to the outside world have disintegrated, and after he or she has become disoriented from the jail experience and has been sufficiently degraded, he or she is ripe for assimilation into the rabble existence. In this process, known as <strong>preparation</strong>, the inmate creates an identity that incorporates the criminal lifestyle. Preparation, according to Irwin (1985), involves three steps. First, the inmate overcomes the psychological barrier that separates the rabble class from other reputable members of society. This barrier is removed after prolonged interaction with other members of the rabble class. Soon the inmate starts to believe that jail life is not as bad as when it was first experienced. In short, the jail inmate adapts to and accepts the rabble mentality. Associated with the removal of this psychological barrier are attitudes and behaviors&mdash;such as being wary and opportunistic&mdash;that enable the inmate to survive in jail. The &ldquo;loss of conventional sensibilities&rdquo; (Irwin, 1985, p. 85) is a necessary part of adopting the rabble mentality.</p>

<a id="p68"></a>

<p class="tx">A preparation process occurs in most jails, whereby the values and attitudes of the jail become part of the inmate&rsquo;s existence. Similar to the general process of adapting to prison, the second step toward the rabble mentality is recognizing the cultural cues at work in the jail. This includes communicating like and accepting the behaviors of those who are the most respected members of the jail setting. For the rabble, as Irwin (1985) describes, this means discussing life on the streets, the decisions of the courts, and what is occurring in prisons, or &ldquo;the joint.&rdquo; The process of preparing for the rabble existence is powerful and affects all inmates differently. Their differential attachment is contingent on past experiences with jails and the rabble class. Prolonged interaction with the rabble class will encourage identification with and acceptance of their norms, values, and attitudes and may be one of the most negative consequences of jail confinement.</p>

<p class="tx">Finally, the preparation process enables members of the rabble class to establish a network of social relationships that endure once they are released into the community. In other words, the rabble class continues to know and interact with each other on the streets. Ostensibly, the preparation process provides the released offender with the necessary connections to continue a criminal lifestyle. In effect, an offender&rsquo;s status as a member of the rabble class is reinforced by doing jail time and connecting with others who are in the same predicament. Being released from jail or detention, therefore, is a mere physical change for many inmates&mdash;a geographic shift from the jail to the streets. Because they have adopted the rabble mentality, they are primed to continue a life of crime and deviance and are supported in such endeavors by other members of the rabble class.</p>

<p class="tx">The most definitive work done on the rabble hypothesis was conducted by two researchers who examined a particular subclass of rabble&mdash;the homeless. Fitzpatrick and Myrstol (2011) analyzed data from 47,592 interviews conducted with jailed adults in 30 cities as part of the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program. They found that the homeless population was overrepresented among arrestees and those booked into the jail and was much more likely to be arrested for low-level crimes and property offenses. The homeless represent those members of society who have experienced higher rates of alcohol and drug abuse and mental health issues. In effect, the jail has become the &ldquo;new&rdquo; mental health facility for those who are not treated through traditional mental health institutions. As noted by Faust (2003), &ldquo;the three largest de facto psychiatric facilities in the United States are now the Los Angeles County Jail, Rikers Island in New York City, and the Cook County jail in Chicago&rdquo; (p. 6). Fitzpatrick and Myrstol (2011) suggest that pursuing a policy of rabble management through incarcerating the homeless is a choice rather than an imperative and that the jail, as well as other components of the criminal justice system, could move beyond rabble management to positively intervene in the lives of the incarcerated. Stinchcomb et al. (2012) make a similar argument and note that some jails are starting to develop new organizational identities that stress human service and treatment for offenders. We will see an example of this type of effort later in the chapter.</p>

<h1 class="h1" id="sec3.5">3.5&ensp;Mental Illness Among Jail Inmates</h1>

<p class="tx">Many inmates in the contemporary jail suffer from some type of mental illness. According to Bronson and Berzofsky (2017), in 2011 approximately 44% of jail inmates were diagnosed with a mental health issue such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder prior to being incarcerated. Other research indicates that mental illness among jail inmates ranges from mild depression to major mental illness categorized as serious psychological distress (Bronson &amp; Berzofsky, 2017). Unfortunately, very little is known about what mental health services are provided to jail inmates (Steadman, McCarty, &amp; Morrissey, 1989; Stinchcomb &amp; McCampbell, 2008). Most of the existing research focuses on the prevalence of mental illness among jail inmates and indicates that the problem is significant. </p>

</div>


<p class="tx">Inmates&rsquo; mental health issues are compounded by additional problems that are also found in high rates among jailed inmates, such as suicide and drug and alcohol addiction (Cornelius, 2008). For example, one survey of jail inmates (Bronson, Stroop, Zimmer, &amp; Berzofsky, 2017) indicated that from 2007 to 2009, over two thirds met the criteria for drug dependence or abuse. According to James and Glaze (2006), over 50% of inmates reported engaging in binge drinking and 80% reported using one of four illicit substances&mdash;marijuana, opiates, methamphetamines, or phencyclidine&mdash;prior to incarceration. Similarly, Green, Miranda, Daroowalla, and Siddique (2005) sampled 100 female prisoners and found a high incidence of lifetime trauma (98%), current mental disorders (36%), and drug and alcohol problems (74%). Ultimately, it is clear that both mental health issues and substance abuse issues are pronounced in jail settings.</p>

<p class="tx">More importantly, the existing research only reveals the number of inmates diagnosed with mental illness and does not reflect on the <em>causes</em> of such mental health issues. Gibbs (1987) has argued that much of what is known about mental illness in jail settings is based on person-centered explanations that suggest that mental health problems are brought into the jail by inmates. His research, in contrast, suggests that many mental health problems experienced by inmates can be traced to environmental causes. That is, mental health problems may stem from the jail setting itself, or, if an inmate is predisposed toward mental illness, the jail setting can exacerbate the situation. By implication, therefore, the environmental view requires that those who work in the jail modify the setting so that mental health problems do not worsen; they should also take measures to limit the potential for inmates to develop mental health problems.</p>

<a id="p70"></a>

<h2 class="h2">The Role of the Correctional Officer</h2>
<p class="tx">The correctional officer can help inmates alleviate the everyday stresses of jail life (Lombardo, 1985; Callahan, 2004). Correctional officers can be trained on how to teach inmates to cope with the stresses of the jail environment. Over time, working closely with mentally ill inmates familiarizes correctional officers with behavioral cues that are consistent with psychological distress (Lombardo, 1985; Gallanek, 2015). Correctional officers with such training can work with prison psychologists and counseling staff to identify inmates in need of psychiatric treatment. Not only can this strategy help inmates cope with jail, it can also enable the officer to expand the correctional role to include other forms of human service delivery (Toch &amp; Klofas,&nbsp;1982)</p>

<p class="tx">Limited funds and a professional culture that often stresses surveillance and control make it very difficult for correctional staff to maintain mental health support services (Drapkin, 2010). Most jails across the country have limited mental health services for inmates, and it is unclear whether the ones that exist adequately meet inmates&rsquo; needs (Koons, Burrow, Morash, &amp; Bynum, 1997). Nevertheless, there has been much attention paid to the plight of mentally ill inmates in jail, and many jails have developed policies to deal with the problem. This has forced them to reconsider their mission and pursue strategies that move beyond warehousing offenders toward other goals more consistent with reform.</p>

<h2 class="h2">The Crisis Intervention Team Model</h2>
<p class="tx">One approach to jails&rsquo; mental health crisis is called the <strong>crisis intervention team (CIT)</strong> model. This strategy recognizes the importance of enlisting mental health professionals to help jails address prisoners&rsquo; mental health issues. CIT has its roots in law enforcement attempts to more effectively deal with the mentally ill they encounter in the community (Steadman et al., 2001; Watson &amp; Fulambarker, 2012). </p>

<p class="tx">Initially, CIT was launched to help law enforcement better address the needs of the mentally ill and to allow people suffering from mental illness who are suspected of breaking the law to be quickly transferred to an appropriate facility with a crisis team, thereby allowing the police to resume their regular duties (McGuire &amp; Bond, 2011). Others have suggested that CIT can also be used in jails to more effectively manage difficult prisoners who have high mental health needs (Kerle, 2012). The goal of CIT is not only to redirect offenders out of jail but to change the way society conceives of jails. Research suggests that jails could provide treatment options that would reduce inmates&rsquo; criminal behavior, drug abuse, and recidivism (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2000).</p>

<p class="tx">The jail&rsquo;s mission must be refocused so it better addresses offenders&rsquo; needs and ultimately serves the public in a more effective way. This will be challenging given the jail&rsquo;s history and traditional purposes. Recent research suggests that the time has come for jails to refocus their mission and direct limited resources toward dealing with offenders in ways that have scientific merit and produce tangible results (Stinchcomb et al., 2012). Furthermore, research indicates that investing in treatment, including jail treatment programming, can produce a return on investment of 12:1 (Travis, 2005). This means for every dollar spent, society will see a $12 reduction in costs associated with substance abuse crimes, criminal justice expenditures, and health care.</p>


<a id="p71"></a>

<div class="box-2">
<h1 class="h1"><strong>Applying Criminal Justice:</strong> <em>How to Manage the Mentally Ill in Jails</em></h1>

<p class="tx">Ken Kerle, the former editor of <em>American Jails Magazine</em>, has stated that the greatest challenge facing 21st-century jails is the sizable presence of mentally ill offenders. This chapter described the various estimates of mental illness among jail inmates and how some jails&mdash;such as the Los Angeles County Jail, which has over 22,000 prisoners, many of whom suffer from mild to severe mental illness&mdash;have become the largest mental health facilities in the United States.</p>

<p class="tx">Are jails equipped to provide mental health services to prisoners? Are jail personnel qualified to provide such services? What are the difficulties of being a primary provider of mental health services in a jail? What are other options for dealing with the mentally ill in jail? The chapter mentions one promising strategy: the creation of CITs to work in jails. What are the strengths of this approach to managing mentally ill offenders? What are some of its limitations?</p>

<p class="tx">In addition, what role should other agencies, such as departments of mental health, play in helping jails provide mental health services to inmates? Should community agencies and families assume more responsibility for managing mentally ill offenders, both inside the jail and outside in the community?</p>

<p class="tx">Some have argued that jails are the final repository for people no one wants. Is this true about the mentally ill in jails? Others have argued that jails have no choice but to become more than just a place to manage society&rsquo;s rabble. This view suggests that jails can be a place where mentally ill offenders can receive effective treatment. Do you agree or disagree, and&nbsp;why?</p>

<div class="clear-both"></div>
</div>

<br/>
<h1 class="eoc-h1" id="ch03Conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>

<p class="tx">This chapter explored the American jail system from both an historical perspective and a more contemporary view. It discussed how jail has always been a &ldquo;dumping ground&rdquo; for society&rsquo;s most undesirable and disreputable individuals. Therefore, the conditions of many jails&mdash;in both 19th-century America and today&mdash;have been poor. In addition, jail demographics indicate that the poor, the uneducated, and the underemployed predominate in jail. In short, the jail has served as the repository for society&rsquo;s most disenfranchised and alienated members.</p>

<p class="tx">Moreover, the conditions of many jails indicate that very few do much for those incarcerated. The processes of jail push the inmate toward the &ldquo;rabble class,&rdquo; and the jail&rsquo;s primary purpose in modern society has become rabble management. While not all prisoners experience jail in exactly the same way, the incentives and structures that reinforce the rabble lifestyle are very strong. The rabble management approach has influenced a number of types of jail designs and philosophies. These philosophies are reflected in the kinds of models featured in modern jails: linear/intermittent surveillance, podular/remote surveillance, and podular/direct supervision. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, but many professional associations and jail practitioners believe the podular/direct model is the jail of the future because it is most likely to remove or slow the processes that contribute to the rabble class.</p>

<a id="p72"></a>

<p class="tx">Finally, we examined the problem of the mentally ill inmate. Our discussion focused on the prevalence of mental illness among jail inmates and the uncertainty regarding the types of services they are provided. We concluded that mental illness among jail inmates may be occurring with the same frequency as in the past, but more effort is being put into accommodating those who suffer from mental health problems. One such effort is the CIT model, which reconceptualizes the jail&rsquo;s mission and purpose. The 21st-century jail has the potential to be more than a mere human warehouse; it can be a place where offenders can receive treatment, thus breaking the cycle of criminal behavior. Jailing processes can also be changed to promote more law-abiding behavior among criminal offenders.</p>
