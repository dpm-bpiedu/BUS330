    <h1 class="tablecontent" id="preface">Preface</h1>

    <p class="tx">As consumers, we each experience what could be marketing case studies every day. We are exposed to
      thousands of advertising messages. We develop needs, research solutions, evaluate options, make purchases, and
      experience satisfaction or disappointment. This makes marketing a particularly stimulating subject for teachers
      and learners, since its practical application is visible every day.</p>

    <p class="tx">The practice of marketing is undergoing unprecedented transformation as the 21st century unfolds.
      Today&#x2019;s consumers are choosing products and companies for new reasons. They are more aware, more active,
      and more powerful than they have ever been. The old rules of marketing are no longer useful to those who want to
      influence these new consumers&#x2019; choices. This textbook explores the leading edge of the paradigm shift that
      is now underway.</p>

    <p class="tx">The book is organized into four areas:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">Introduction to Marketing and Its Processes (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2)</li>
      <li class="nl">The Marketing Mix (Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Chapter 6)</li>
      <li class="nl">The Marketing Environment (Chapter 7 and Chapter 8)</li>
      <li class="nl">Marketing Management (Chapter 9 and Chapter 10)</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">The logic behind this organization is to first introduce students to the concepts and processes of
      marketing, to follow that with an exploration of the aspects that are under marketers&#x2019; control, then to
      broaden the discussion to include the uncontrollable factors of customers and the environment. The final chapters
      echo the initial introduction but take the student deeper into the work of marketing.</p>

    <p class="tx">Figures illustrate concepts as needed to facilitate comprehension. Field Trips link to online content
      related to topics discussed in each chapter. While not required reading, Field Trips give students an opportunity
      to apply concepts learned and to observe contemporary marketing in action, in real time. </p>

    <p class="tx">Each chapter concludes with a case study and critical thinking questions that allow you, the learner,
      to apply concepts by drawing on your own life experience.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="ch01intro">Introduction</h1>

    <p class="tx">Marketing is the process that involves all of a firm&#x2019;s activities to get its customers to buy
      its goods or services. In return, customers get value for their money from buying the firm&#x2019;s goods or
      services. Marketing is the heart and soul of a successful business plan. A business that does not include a
      marketing plan is more likely to fail. One can look at marketing as a process that involves a wide range of
      activities. A marketer&#x2019;s role is to carry out all the activities of marketing. </p>

    <p class="tx">Suppose you go to the store and purchase a particular product, or a friend calls you and tells you
      about how good a product is that he or she has used; all of these activities involve marketing. We are all
      involved in marketing. We are doing it all the time. Marketing has been a part of our life since we learned how to
      buy things.</p>

    <p class="tx">The American Marketing Association (AMA) defines <strong>marketing</strong> as &quot;the activity, set
      of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value
      for customers, clients, partners, and society at large&quot; (<a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://Marketingpower.com">Marketingpower.com</a>, 2001). This definition includes the term
      <em>value</em>, which this chapter will explore in depth.</p>

    <p class="tx">Value is the fundamental concept on which marketing is based. <strong>Value</strong> is the perceived
      trade-off between benefits and the sacrifice required to take possession of those benefits&#x2014;a relationship
      that constantly changes based on shifting circumstances.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing activities are intended to convince would-be buyers that they have found a good
      value&#x2014;a satisfactory trade-off&#x2014;and so should exchange their money for that value.
      <strong>Exchange</strong> is key to achieving the objectives of marketing. Exchange is characterized by trading
      things of value between buyer and seller so that each perceives him- or herself as better off after
      the&#xA0;trade.</p>

    <p class="tx">Although marketing has been a core business activity since the early 20th century&#x2014;and has
      existed in some form since the first cave dwellers thought to swap food for their neighbors&#x2019;
      furs&#x2014;its practice is rapidly evolving as marketers adapt to the influences of changing consumers, advancing
      technologies, and globalization. This chapter introduces the fundamentals that endure from traditional marketing
      and then builds on that base with insight into the methodology of contemporary marketing practice.</p>

    <p class="tx">Why is marketing important? Unlike some fields, marketing is a subject with which you will engage for
      your entire life&#x2014;and in fact, have engaged with since you were a toddler. The minute you became able to
      express your desires&#x2014;and thus influence your parents&#x2019; purchase decisions&#x2014;you have been a
      target of marketers&#x2019; attention. Until it is time to execute the preplanning form for your funeral, which
      specifies the make and model of your casket (or urn or mushroom-impregnated biodegradable shroud), you will be a
      consumer in the marketing process. It is worth studying marketing simply to better understand how you are affected
      by, and how you can have an effect on, marketing practices. Just as important, you may decide to make marketing
      your life&#x2019;s work. The field offers interesting and rewarding career opportunities suited to diverse talents
      and aptitudes (see Chapter 10). And the forecast for marketing&#x2019;s continued relevance and rising employment
      are good, for the simple reason that no business can exist without it.</p>

    <a id="p3"></a>
    <p class="tx">Peter Drucker (1974), considered the father of management consulting, said: </p>

    <p class="ext">Because the purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two&#x2014;and
      only two&#x2014;basic functions: marketing and innovation. Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest
      are costs. Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business. (p. 61)</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing and innovation are inextricably linked. Marketing encourages innovation; it is the channel
      by which firms learn about customers&#x2019; evolving needs and desires. When firms develop new and better ways to
      satisfy customers, those firms grow, driving fuller employment and higher incomes. No matter a company&#x2019;s
      size, marketing is crucial to its survival and, hopefully, its growth. And because a firm&#x2019;s prosperity is
      linked to the well-being of its employees and customers, effective marketing can help everyone in a firm.</p>

    <p class="tx">Now that you are (hopefully) convinced that marketing is a subject worthy of your attention,
      let&#x2019;s begin our investigation of its concepts and practical applications. Imagine it is a summer morning in
      Anywhere, U.S.A. In the town square, a farm-stand operator positions his produce in appealing pyramids and greets
      the first buyers of the day. In the industrial park across town, a marketing manager at a corporate office reviews
      a bid from an ad agency to create a campaign for a new mobile communications product. Back on Main Street, a
      florist urges a bride to select her wedding&#x2019;s theme so she can prepare a floral design estimate.
      What&#x2019;s going on here? The answer is marketing.</p>

    <p class="tx">In each situation, an <strong>exchange process</strong> is taking place&#x2014;two or more parties are
      going to give something of value in order to receive something perceived to satisfy a need. Buyers are about to
      give money to sellers in exchange for vegetables, advertising services, and wedding flowers. All that remains is
      for both parties in each exchange to be convinced that the relationship between the thing given and the thing
      received is fair.</p>

    <p class="tx">Each of these sellers is engaged in a marketing function, which must be managed for their companies to
      bring out the exchange&#x2019;s profit potential. The AMA defines <strong>marketing management</strong> as
      &quot;the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods,
      and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organizational objectives&quot; (<a class="link"
        target="_blank" href="http://Marketingpower.com">Marketingpower.com</a>, 2001).</p>

    <p class="tx">The goal of this book is to prepare students for a role in marketing management in
      today&#x2019;s&#x2014;and tomorrow&#x2019;s&#x2014;workplace. The goal of this chapter and the next is to solidly
      ground you in contemporary marketing principles and practices, the foundation for contextual understanding of
      marketing management.</p>

    <p class="tx">Understanding contemporary marketing thought and its implications for tomorrow&#x2019;s marketing
      practitioners, however, requires an understanding of the history of marketing.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec1.1">1.1&#x2002;A Brief History of Marketing </h1>

    <p class="tx">Although marketing has always been a function in business, its importance has grown over time.
      Marketing educators have identified four eras in the history of marketing:</p>

    <a id="p4"></a>
    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"> production era</li>
      <li class="nl"> sales era</li>
      <li class="nl"> marketing era or consumer orientation era </li>
      <li class="nl"> relationship era</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="photo-right">
      <img id="img1.1" class="scaled" alt="Workers in an iron factory." title="Workers in an iron factory."
        src="images/1.1.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Ivan-96/DigitalVision Vectors/Getty</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">The rise of the industrial economy created both goods to buy and markets with the means
        to buy them.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="tx">As each of these eras gave way to the next, prevailing attitudes and practices in marketing changed
      significantly (Kurtz, 2010). Today businesses appear to be on the cusp of what may be a fifth era, which we will
      discuss later (Kotler, 2010).</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing took shape as a key business function in the early 20th century, but it is rooted in
      exchanges of goods and services that have been with us from the early formation of human societies. Marketing is
      just one of several means to accomplish the social objective of meeting and satisfying people&#x2019;s needs. </p>

    <p class="tx">The earliest form of marketing could be said to have emerged when individuals went beyond producing
      goods for their own use to some form of reciprocity. Some societies practiced <em>redistribution</em>, a system in
      which an authority assembles goods and redistributes them, as a medieval lord might manage the needs of his serfs.
      As societies became more sophisticated, social systems based on <strong>trade</strong> emerged. This form of
      exchange involves price equivalencies determined by treaties or administrative decisions. When economic forces
      (primarily supply and demand) supplant other systems for supplying a society&#x2019;s material needs, that society
      has achieved a <strong>market system</strong>, which is the model currently in use throughout most developed
      countries (Bartels, 1976). In some developing countries, market systems have not yet supplanted other means of
      exchanging value to meet material needs. Gift giving, reciprocity, and trade are still valid systems for
      exchanging value, but there is little place for marketers in those systems.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.1.1">The Production Era</h2>

    <p class="tx">After the Industrial Revolution (roughly 1750&#x2013;1850) offered merchants the ability to distribute
      goods more widely, opportunity arose for production on a larger scale. The transition from an agricultural economy
      to an industrial one created both markets for goods and great quantities of goods to buy. By the end of the 19th
      century, the shift from production for use to production for exchange was well established. Business managers
      began to use concepts from economics related to distribution (Bartels, 1976).</p>

    <p class="tx">As the 20th century commenced, a <strong>buyer&#x2019;s market</strong> (in which there are more goods
      and services available than people wanting to buy them) was replacing a <strong>seller&#x2019;s market</strong>
      (in which buyers outnumber the goods and services they want to buy). The proliferation of goods introduced the
      need for those goods to be differentiated from each other. In response, marketing rose in importance. The first
      marketing practitioners strove to comprehend the concept of value, leading to our current understanding of the
      exchange of money for goods or services that deliver needed or desired benefits (utility). Still, the prevailing
      attitude was that &quot;a good product will sell itself.&quot; Manufacturers focused producing goods and then
      looked for customers to buy them (Kurtz, 2010).</p>

    <a id="p5"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.1.2">The Sales Era</h2>
    <p class="tx">In the early 20th century, what we recognize as modern marketing thought emerged from the work of
      economists who recognized that <strong>demand</strong> consisted of more than simple purchasing power. Desire and
      ability to purchase also affected demand. The breakthrough that created a recognizable discipline of marketing was
      the realization that desire could be driven by factors other than merely supply&#x2014;and that the effectiveness
      of selling, advertising, and promotional activity could be enhanced through study of social sciences such as
      psychology and sociology.</p>

    <p class="tx">Between 1900 and 1930, the advertising discipline came into being, concerned with copy and layout in
      advertising campaigns, based on principles of economics and psychology as well as trends in the arts and cultural
      environment. <strong>Market research</strong>, the &quot;nucleus for strategic market planning&quot; (Hair, Bush,
      &amp; Ortinau, 2003, p. 7), also took shape as a discipline, and the paradigm of marketing as a blend of art and
      science was established. By the 1940s market research was driven by rigorous statistical methodology. The
      functions of middlemen (distributors, sales agents, etc.) were recognized. The power of advertising to persuade
      and motivate was also recognized.</p>

    <p class="tx">When major business strategies were discussed, people with a marketing perspective began to take a
      seat at the table alongside production and engineering leaders. However, they tended to remain subordinates in
      terms of power and to hold titles like &quot;sales manager&quot; rather than &quot;marketing director&quot;
      (Kurtz, 2010). The belief that a sufficiently powerful sales message could overcome any consumer&#x2019;s
      resistance prevailed.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.1.3">The Marketing Era</h2>
    <p class="tx">The emergence of the marketing era can be linked to the end of World War II, when factories shifted
      from producing for the war effort back to manufacturing consumer products. The seller&#x2019;s market created by
      wartime shortages became a buyer&#x2019;s market again, booming with pent-up demand.</p>

    <p class="tx">The marketing era was characterized by increasing professional specialization in the marketing
      discipline, with an emphasis on managerial decision making, quantitative analysis, and recognition of the societal
      aspects of marketing (Bartels, 1976).</p>

    <p class="tx">In the postwar 1950s and 1960s, marketing thought developed along two main avenues&#x2014;the power of
      creativity and the power of science. Those decades were characterized by increasing analysis of consumer
      motivation, drawing on concepts from the behavioral sciences. This analysis brought recognition of markets as
      having segments distinguished by geography, mental attitudes, density of population, and ethnic/racial
      characteristics (Bartels, 1976). This gave rise to the use of psychological constructs like consumer motivation,
      beliefs, and attitudes to develop sales appeals. These new techniques drove the era of advertising&#x2019;s
      &quot;creative revolution&quot; (<em>Ad Age</em>, 2003, para. 2).</p>

    <a id="p6"></a>
    <p class="tx">The 1970s brought awareness that not only did society influence marketing, but marketing influenced
      society. Deceptive marketing practices were increasingly criticized (<em>Ad Age</em>, 2003). This marked the first
      glimmer of another radical shift in marketing thought. Companies began not just to measure and observe consumers
      but to <em>listen</em> to them. Businesses shifted toward a <strong>consumer orientation</strong>&#x2014;the
      philosophy that suggests that by determining consumers&#x2019; unmet needs, businesses can better design goods and
      services to satisfy them. This in turn led companies to commit to the <strong>marketing concept</strong>. The
      objective became company-wide consumer orientation to enjoy long-term success. Even during economic downturns,
      when companies sought to cut costs to raise revenues, the marketing concept kept companies focused on the
      objective of long-term success rather than short-term profits (Kurtz, 2010). Company-wide, the word went out that
      the customer was king, and the company&#x2019;s duty was to identify potential customers&#x2019; needs and fill
      them.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers began to realize the need to develop products to meet the varying preferences of different
      customer segments, and they quickly embraced <strong>segmentation</strong> systems based on the work of social
      scientists. The first system to gain broad acceptance was the VALS (Values, Attitudes, and Lifestyles) framework,
      developed in 1978 by SRI International, which segmented consumers by primary motivation and resources (Lawson
      &amp; Todd, 2002).</p>

    <p class="tx">Segmentation heralded greater understanding of consumer behavior. Fast on its heels came the concept
      of <strong>target marketing</strong>&#x2014;the realization that not all segments can be served profitably.
      Targeting is essential to focus marketing resources on the people who are likely to have the most use for a
      company&#x2019;s offerings as well as to be the most profitable as customers. Marketers began focusing attention
      on <strong>positioning</strong> their products and services&#x2014;creating an image or identity in the minds of
      the <strong>target market</strong>, striving for a unique place (position) that would allow one offering to stand
      out among many. Marketers termed this goal <strong>competitive differentiation</strong>.</p>

    <p class="tx">In 1980 Theodore Levitt made a compelling case that the key to differentiation lay in recognizing that
      buyers purchase more than just a particular physical product or service in the buying exchange. They also place
      value on the ease of the transaction, the credit terms offered, the reliability of the seller, and more.
      &quot;Even when the physical product or service is immutable, the augmented product is invariably
      differentiable,&quot; he wrote (Levitt, 1980, p. 85). By the close of the marketing era, marketing practice was
      characterized by the <strong>STP approach</strong>&#x2014;segmentation, targeting, and positioning. A rising
      emphasis on differentiation matched the increasing array of goods and services available in a burgeoning consumer
      marketplace.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.1.4">The Relationship Era</h2>
    <p class="tx">Toward the close of the 20th century, companies increasingly focused on controlling costs to maintain
      profitability in the face of increasing competition. Marketers recognized that long-term relationships with
      customers not only reduced investment in new-customer acquisition but created more value for both the customers
      and the companies themselves. <strong>Relationship marketing</strong> began to emerge around 1990. In the
      relationship era, organizations realized that by focusing on establishing enduring relationships with customers,
      suppliers, and other partners, they could not just capture today&#x2019;s sale but convert today&#x2019;s new
      customer into tomorrow&#x2019;s regular purchaser and perhaps earn a customer loyal for a lifetime. Marketers
      added the phrase <strong>customer experience</strong> to their vocabulary, expressing the insight that the
      experience customers remember about interacting with a company and its products makes or breaks that relationship.
      The concept of <strong>customer lifetime value</strong> was recognized and defined&#x2014;a calculation that could
      put a dollar value on these relationships by estimating the total profit (or loss) likely to result from an
      ongoing business relationship with a customer over the life of that relationship.</p>

    <a id="p7"></a>
    <p class="tx">Around this time, another important consumer shift was taking place that reshaped marketing. It began
      with proliferation of the personal computer. Technology reshaped access to information, leading to better informed
      consumers with greater ability to compare similar product offerings. By the end of the 20th century, marketers
      faced a new challenge: how to differentiate offerings in a crowded marketplace in the minds of these well-informed
      and savvy shoppers. The key marketing insight of the relationship era is that the profitability promised by
      long-term relationships with customers is sufficient to make the challenging act of differentiating offerings
      worth the considerable investment required. The imperative for marketers is to find and hold a unique position in
      the minds of consumers in order to gain and maintain those valuable relationships.</p>

      <p class="photo-caption">Philip Kotler has been a leading marketing practitioner and teacher for decades. In 2010
        Kotler observed that marketing is undergoing another radical shift.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Marketing thought leader Philip Kotler conceptualizes development of the marketing profession somewhat
      differently than the model introduced in the previous section.</p>

    <p class="tx">According to Kotler, who is also a professor of international marketing at the Kellogg School of
      Management at Northwestern University, the terms <em>product-centric</em>, <em>consumer-centric</em>, and
      <em>humanity-centric</em> characterize three major generations of marketing thought. Most of the 20th century was
      dominated by <strong>product-centric</strong> marketing, in which the goal was to scale up production of
      standardized products with an emphasis on lowering costs of production so the goods could be made more affordable
      to more buyers (Kotler, 2010). But consumers vary widely in their preferences. By the 1980s computing power and
      research techniques brought new methodologies to understand and respond to consumers (Lawson &amp; Todd, 2002). To
      use Kotler&#x2019;s terms, the practice of marketing became <strong>consumer-centric</strong>. </p>

    <a id="p9"></a>
    <p class="tx">As the 21st century gets under way, Kotler has observed that marketing is undergoing another radical
      shift. The marketing discipline is evolving away from consumer-centricity, which for all its emphasis on consumers
      still viewed them as passive targets of marketing. The discipline is recognizing the collaborative and
      participatory nature of the business landscape, transformed by the latest wave of communication technology.
      Consumers increasingly influence each other by sharing opinions and experiences, diminishing marketers&#x2019;
      influence through advertising channels. Consumers increasingly participate directly in business by contributing
      ideas for product development and advertising messages.</p>

    <p class="tx">Recognizable in this shift described by Kotler are elements of the relationship era, with its focus on
      collaboration and participation. But Kotler takes the idea further.</p>

    <p class="tx">Kotler (2010) characterized this new generation as <strong>humanity-centric</strong>&#x2014;concerned
      with &quot;whole human beings with minds, hearts, and spirits&quot; (2010, p. 10). Marketing now seeks to
      contribute to sustaining and improving the world, not just meet customer expectations or serve corporate goals.
      Following the practice of numbering software generations, Kotler has dubbed the new generation <strong>Marketing
        3.0</strong>.</p>

    <p class="tx">Kotler differentiates the humanity-centric Marketing 3.0 now emerging from the two past generations of
      <em>Marketing 2.0</em> (information-driven and consumer-centric) and <em>Marketing 1.0</em> (industry-driven and
      product-centric). In Kotler&#x2019;s writing and teaching since publishing <em>Marketing 3.0</em> in 2010, he has
      put forward an even more empowered and engaged view of the consumer. He places new emphasis on a marketplace where
      power has shifted to &quot;horizontal, inclusive, social forces&quot; (Kotler, 2017, p. 35)&#x2014;those empowered
      consumers who demand socially and environmentally responsible behavior from the organizations that market
      to&#xA0;them. </p>

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. The three generations of marketing thought and practice defined by Kotler
      is another possible framework for understanding the evolution of marketing.</p>

    <a id="p10"></a>

    <p class="tx">Kotler&#x2019;s framework, which may already be evolving toward Marketing 4.0, is useful in that it
      points toward significant consumer shifts not recognized by the earlier &quot;four eras&quot; framework. </p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.2.1">What Comes Next?</h2>
    <p class="tx">When you enter the marketing field, will you take your place in the relationship era, or Marketing
      3.0&#x2019;s humanity-centric era, or will other terms have come into use? How will marketing objectives,
      insights, and responses to the business environment be characterized as the 21st century unfolds? What&#x2019;s in
      a name?</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing thought and practice change at different paces in different industries and within different
      companies. There is still a lot of consumer-centric Marketing 2.0 being practiced. Even product-centric Marketing
      1.0 can be observed&#x2014;and in surprising places. Steve Jobs, former CEO of Apple, famously said,
      &quot;It&#x2019;s not the consumers&#x2019; job to know what they want&quot; (as cited in Carr, 2011, para. 11).
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Kotler&#x2019;s proposition that the Marketing 3.0 era is upon us has not yet been proven, and the
      idea of it will no doubt evolve over time. Still, given his track record as a leader in marketing thought, his
      proposition is worth closer study.</p>

    <p class="tx">As we begin to do business in a Marketing 3.0 world, Kotler states that three major forces are shaping
      the business landscape:</p>


    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"> consumers&#x2019; demand for participation, via meaningful dialogue and engagement</li>
      <li class="nl"> the <strong>globalization paradox</strong>, in which businesses must serve individuals who are
        feeling the pressure to be both global as well as local citizens</li>
      <li class="nl"> the age of a creative society, in which more people work and live like creative scientists and
        artists</li>
    </ol>


    <p class="tx">Kotler draws these threads together, observing that spirituality has replaced survival as the prime
      need of human beings. He states, &quot;Supplying meaning is the future value proposition of marketing&quot;
      (Kotler, 2010, p. 20). At the close of this chapter, we will return for a closer look at the three major forces
      identified by Kotler. But first, let&#x2019;s consider the needs of humans&#x2014;what they want, what they
      require, and how they place monetary value on the goods and services that meets those needs and desires.</p>

      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Does Kotler&#x2019;s framework of Marketing 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 gloss over significant developments in
        the evolution of marketing thought? Why do you think he chose to build a new proposed framework rather than
        simply add to the prevailing thought of other marketers?</p>
    </div>




    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec1.3">1.3&#x2002;Delivering Customer Value</h1>

    <p class="tx">In the introduction, marketing was defined as an activity designed to stimulate exchanges that have
      <em>value</em> for customers, partners, and society at large. Value was defined as the perceived trade-off between
      benefits and the sacrifice required to take possession of those benefits. Another definition states, &quot;Value
      is what customers get (benefits, quality, worth, utility) from the purchase and use of a product versus what they
      pay (price, costs, sacrifices), resulting in an attitude toward, or an emotional bond with, the product&quot;
      (Smith &amp; Colgate, 2007, p. 10).</p>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Customer value</strong>, then, is simply a name for the value a specific exchange has for the
      customer (buyer) as opposed to the company (seller). No one questions whether companies attempt to deliver
      customer value in the goods and services they offer. The question is how well they succeed in that attempt. To
      study that question requires a framework for understanding customer value.</p>

    <p class="tx">Value doesn&#x2019;t stand still to be studied under a microscope. It is, in the words of Smith and
      Colgate (2007), interactive, conditional, relativistic, and dynamic. What do they mean? Let&#x2019;s break this
      down word by word:</p>



    <div class="photo-right">
      <img id="img1.3" class="scaled" alt="Froot Loops cereal." title="Froot Loops cereal." src="images/1.3.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Choness/iStock/Getty Images Plus</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">If you ate Froot Loops frequently as a child, you might occasionally want a bowl of them,
        even though they may not be your usual choice&#x2014;evidence of the marketing insight that value is dynamic.
      </p>
    </div>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"> <em>Interactive:</em> Individuals perceive value in unique ways; thus, value interacts with the
        person perceiving it. The value Bob places on a box of Froot Loops will be different from the value Katie places
        on the same box of cereal.</li>
      <li class="bl"> <em>Conditional:</em> Value changes depending on context&#x2014;the individual, the situation, and
        the product(s) involved at the moment value is appraised. The value Bob or Katie places on Froot Loops goes up
        or down with how hungry they each are while considering the purchase.</li>
      <li class="bl"> <em>Relativistic:</em> Value depends on comparing with known or imagined alternatives. If Bob
        prefers unsweetened cereal, the value he places on Froot Loops will be lower than the value he places on
        Shredded Wheat.</li>
      <li class="bl"> <em>Dynamic:</em> Value changes within an individual over time. If Bob and Katie ate Froot Loops
        frequently as children, as adults they may regard Froot Loops with nostalgia that creates desire for an
        occasional bowlful, even though it is not their usual breakfast choice.</li>
    </ul>

    <a id="p12"></a>
    <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s consider another example. Imagine that Katie and Bob are both part of a growing trend to
      go car-free. Katie has chosen to purchase a commuter bicycle with a vintage style that reflects her personal
      tastes. Its comfortable seat and upright riding posture suit her need for a bicycle that can get her to her job a
      few miles from her home. Meanwhile, Bob, who has joined the trend toward urban poultry farming, has chosen a cargo
      bike. That big box over the front wheel isn&#x2019;t very aerodynamic, but it is perfect for quick jaunts to the
      store to buy more chicken feed. </p>

    <p class="tx">Bob and Katie&#x2019;s idea of the perfect bicycle is interactive&#x2014;perceived differently by
      each. The value they place on these bikes is conditional: If either wanted to enter a road race, they would borrow
      a different pair of wheels. The value is relativistic, meaning Bob doesn&#x2019;t covet Katie&#x2019;s commuter
      bike, and Katie wouldn&#x2019;t take Bob&#x2019;s cargo bike if you paid her. It is also dynamic; neither would
      have wanted a bicycle 10 years ago, when buying their first cars was a thrilling rite of passage; and in another
      decade, either may decide to ditch the bike&#x2014;whatever the style&#x2014;for the convenience of a car again.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">As Bob and Katie have shown us, the value an individual places on any particular exchange depends on
      that individual&#x2019;s needs and wants. To deepen our understanding of customer value, then, we must turn our
      attention to the aspect of human behavior concerned with needs and desires.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.3.1">Value Is Driven by Needs and Desires</h2>
    <p class="tx">Persons in a market economy must continually acquire goods and services to fill certain needs, while
      those in other social systems make what they need or engage in gift giving or reciprocal exchanges to fill their
      needs. Every individual and organization has needs and desires, the distinction being that <strong>needs</strong>
      are essential to survival, while <strong>desires</strong> (wants) are nonessential.</p>

    <p class="tx">Abraham Maslow subdivided &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;nonessential&quot; into five levels in the
      model he termed the <strong>hierarchy of needs</strong>. He suggested that people have different types of needs
      that drive them to behave in certain ways. The most basic needs, according to Maslow, are physiological&#x2014;for
      food and drink. Once these basic needs are met, we become concerned with the need for shelter. With that secured,
      we can experience our need for social interaction. When we are interacting in society, we feel the need to be
      liked by others&#x2014;labeled an <em>esteem need</em> by Maslow. Finally, when our more fundamental needs are
      met, we can address our need for creativity and self-expression that fulfill us mentally, emotionally, and
      spiritually, which Maslow called <em>self-actualization</em> (Pride &amp; Ferrell, 2017).</p>

    <p class="tx">Some purchases address a basic need&#x2014;buying a bottle of water after a long hike on a hot
      day&#x2014;while others address a complex suite of Maslow&#x2019;s needs&#x2014;like purchasing a Harley Davidson
      motorcycle to project a desired identity. Whether you think of needs simply as &quot;essential&quot; or
      &quot;nonessential&quot; or parse them to the level of Maslow&#x2019;s pyramid, value is driven by these needs and
      desires.</p>

    <a id="p13"></a>
    <p class="tx">Maslow&#x2019;s work is not without its critics, some of whom feel the ultimate level should be
      transcending the self, rather than actualizing it (Brooks, 2017), and others who suggest that &quot;life is
      messier than that&quot; or feel that Maslow underestimated the importance of social connection (Denning, 2012).
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Regardless of how you parse the factors driving needs and desires, human beings experience them.
      People in a market economy become <strong>consumers</strong> when they are driven to fulfill their needs and
      desires through exchanges. The purchases they make transform them into <strong>customers</strong> of the
      organizations they buy from. Individuals aren&#x2019;t the only ones driven to fill needs and
      wants&#x2014;organizations are also buyers with needs for supplies, personnel, and resources to fulfill their
      missions.</p>

    <p class="tx">When consumers perceive a need or desire, the inner drive that moves them to fulfill the need is
      called <strong>motivation</strong>. We will look closer at motivation in Chapter 7 when we address
      consumers&#x2019; buying behavior and decision making as part of the larger topic of target markets. For now,
      let&#x2019;s focus on the implications of customers&#x2019; needs and desires and how marketing responds.</p>

      <p class="photo-caption">On one side of the scale hang the benefits of an offering; on the other the sacrifices
        required to gain the benefits. Customers perceive value when the scale meets expectations.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.3.2">The Customer Value Equation</h2>

    <p class="tx">As stated earlier, customers place a value on a particular exchange in terms of the perceived
      trade-off between benefits and the sacrifice required to get those benefits. That relationship can be described as
      a ratio of perceived benefits to price, money being the typical sacrifice required. Mathematically, it can be
      expressed as follows (Churchill &amp; Peter, 2003):</p>

    <p class="ext">Value = Perceived benefits/Price</p>

    <p class="tx">This is easily understood by envisioning the ratio as a traditional pan scale. On a scale, it is easy
      to tell when two items are equal&#x2014;the pans hang in balance. In commercial transactions in which value is
      defined by weight, a scale is a perfect tool to determine the equality of two values&#x2014;money and the goods to
      be exchanged for it. Firms offer value &quot;proposition&quot; for their products (goods or services). According
      to Tucker (1995), product value proposition (PVP) is composed of quality, service, and price. </p>

    <p class="ext">PVP = <strong>Q</strong>uality + <strong>S</strong>ervice + <strong>P</strong>rice</p>

    <p class="ext">Q is the quality of the good or service</p>

    <a id="p14"></a>
    <p class="ext">S is the service provided by the product</p>

    <p class="ext">P is the price of the product </p>

    <p class="tx">Tucker (1995) asserts that &quot;when that proposition satisfies, or exceeds the customer&#x2019;s
      expectation, the sale goes through. When it doesn&#x2019;t, the sale doesn&#x2019;t&quot; (p. 34). </p>

    <p class="tx">A pan scale gives tangible evidence of a formula that is present in every purchase transaction: the
      <strong>customer value equation (CVE)</strong>. When customers perceive a balance between the value
      given&#x2014;money&#x2014;and the value received&#x2014;the goods or services&#x2014;they perceive a good value.
      If the scale hangs a bit out of balance, with the value-received side heavier than the money side&#x2014;customers
      see a bargain. But if the scales are too far out of balance, customers begin to think something&#x2019;s not
      right. &quot;Too good to be true,&quot; they murmur, and start to look more closely to see if there is a hidden
      cost that, if known, would change the CVE.</p>

    <p class="tx">A marketer&#x2019;s objective is to develop an offering and price it in such a way that its value
      attracts customers and creates a profitable <strong>bottom line</strong>.</p>

    <p class="tx">But what&#x2019;s all this talk about benefits? People buy stuff to get stuff, don&#x2019;t they? In
      the production era, that was indeed how consumer behavior was perceived. But as marketing thought moved forward, a
      new understanding emerged. People don&#x2019;t buy stuff to get stuff&#x2014;they buy stuff to get the benefits or
      solutions those purchases deliver.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.3.3">Solutions for Sale</h2>
    <p class="tx">Consider Betty, who has a dining room chair that wobbles. A dowel that pins a cross brace in place has
      sheared off, and that brace no longer keeps the chair stable. Someday soon Betty is going to sit down and crash to
      the floor.</p>

    <p class="tx">Betty has a problem. What&#x2019;s the solution? A hole, and a dowel just slightly smaller than that
      hole, so she can drill out the sheared-off dowel, fix the cross brace, and sit down to dinner without fear. Betty
      never wanted a bit, a drill, a dowel, or even a Saturday project. She just wanted her dining room chair whole
      again. But she is going to buy a drill and a dowel and maybe even an instructional booklet on furniture repair.
      Somewhere out there a solution is for sale, and she&#x2019;s looking for it. At the same time, a marketer is
      looking for her. Right now he&#x2019;s probably writing ad copy that says something like &quot;Buy high-quality
      drill bits for less.&quot;</p>

    <p class="tx">The fundamental marketing insight behind this story is that people don&#x2019;t buy goods or services
      to possess them&#x2014;they buy to get the benefit that derives from possession. This insight reflects marketing
      thought in Kotler&#x2019;s consumer-centric Marketing 2.0 generation or, in other words, the marketing era. </p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.3.4">Service-Dominant Logic </h2>
    <p class="tx">A new way of describing this insight moves it forward to the current era, whatever we choose to call
      it. The concept of <strong>service-dominant logic</strong> was proposed in 2004 by Stephen Vargo and Robert Lusch
      to describe the relationship between benefits and possessions. Their term quickly found resonance in the marketing
      community. Service-dominant logic proposes that organizations, markets, and society are fundamentally concerned
      with the exchange of services for the benefits of all parties. Put another way, as Evert Gummesson wrote in 1995,
      &quot;Customers do not buy goods or services. They buy offerings which render services, which create value . . .
      activities render services, things render services&quot; (as cited in Lusch &amp; Vargo, 2007, p. 27).</p>

    <a id="p15"></a>
    <p class="tx">Under this proposition, all firms are service firms, all markets are centered on the exchange of
      services, and all economies and societies are service based. This replaced the inadequate &quot;goods-dominant
      logic&quot; (Lusch &amp; Vargo, 2004) of the past. That logic focused on tangible resources, embedded value, and
      transactions. Lusch and Vargo reframed the discussion to focus on intangible resources, the cocreation of value,
      and the importance of relationships.</p>

    <p class="tx">Seen through the lens of service-dominant logic, the solution to Betty&#x2019;s wobbly chair begins to
      look not like a product at all but a need for a new relationship&#x2014;with a furniture repair service.</p>

      <p class="photo-caption">Is an ice cube tray merely an object designed to facilitate the freezing of water for
        beverages? Seen through the lens of service-dominant logic, the ice cube tray is the means to an ice-cold drink.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.3.5">Experiences Matter, Not Transactions</h2>


    <p class="tx">From the viewpoint of service-dominant logic, experiences matter&#x2014;not transactions. Customers
      buy offerings that render services, which create value. This approach embraces the concepts of
      <strong>value-in-use</strong> (benefits that accrue to a specific owner during a specific use) and
      <strong>cocreation of value</strong>, wherein customers are able to customize and personalize their experience
      through interacting with the service (benefits) of the offering.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider an ice cube tray. In a product-centric interpretation, it is what it is&#x2014;a rectangular
      grid of small receptacles designed to facilitate the freezing of water in small units suitable for chilling
      beverages. Using service-dominant logic, the ice cube tray is reconceptualized as a tool for chilling beverages
      via creation of ice. From a purely service-dominant logic point of view, consumers don&#x2019;t want an ice cube
      tray&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t even want ice. What they want is an ice-cold beverage. They make the purchase that
      will render the service of making ice cubes that will render the service of chilling their drink.</p>

    <p class="tx">Take a moment now to think about Peter Drucker&#x2019;s (1974) statement that &quot;the business
      enterprise has two&#x2014;and only two&#x2014;basic functions: marketing and innovation&quot; (p. 61). When Yeti
      Coolers developed a roto-molded thermal drink cup capable of keeping a beverage cool for 24 hours, the humble
      service rendered by ice cube trays was made obsolete by the experience of owning a Yeti cooler cup, in the eyes of
      the tribe of Yeti aficionados (Kurutz, 2017).</p>

    <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s return to the concept of customer value and see how the four attributes presented earlier
      appear through the lens of service-dominant logic:</p>


    <ul class="bl">

      <li class="bl"> <em>Interactive:</em> Service value interacts with the person perceiving it; the value placed on a
        chilled drink will be different among individuals from different cultures.</li>
      <li class="bl"><a id="p16"></a> <em>Conditional:</em> Service value changes depending on the situation at the
        moment value is appraised. The service that ice renders has more value to an individual finishing a grueling
        workout than to an individual rising from a nap in the shade.</li>
      <li class="bl"> <em>Relativistic:</em> Service value depends on comparison. Given a choice between crushed ice and
        a block of ice to put on a sprained ankle, the injured person is more likely to value the service the crushed
        ice can deliver as it adjusts to the shape of the ankle.</li>
      <li class="bl"> <em>Dynamic:</em> Service value changes within an individual over time. The service that ice
        renders loses much of its value in winter.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">For another example, look at a reading lamp. In a transactional, product-centric sense, it is simply
      an object composed of some electric wiring, a lightbulb, a shade, and a supporting structure. Now view it with
      service-dominant logic&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a pool of light, delivered. What&#x2019;s valuable is not the
      transaction of purchasing a lamp but the solution achieved through the purpose&#x2014;the experience of
      comfortably reading a well-lit page.</p>

    <p class="tx">You have learned that people value things for how they can use them, not just for what they are.
      Different offerings will serve in different ways, to different degrees. Consumers make comparisons, weighing the
      relative value of competing alternatives and using purchase criteria that reflect their expectations and beliefs
      about what will satisfy the want or need driving their search for a solution.</p>

    <a id="p17"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.4.1">The Four Utilities of Customer Value</h2>
    <p class="tx">Marketers have categorized consumers&#x2019; purchase criteria into four categories, termed the

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. The four utilities of customer value are categories to which
      consumers&#x2019; various purchase criteria may be assigned.</p>

    <p class="tx">The <strong>form</strong> utility consists of everything the manufacturer has put into a product, from
      its aesthetics to its durability. The <strong>time</strong> and <strong>place</strong> utilities add value when
      consumers find the product or service available when and where they want to buy it. The <strong>ease of
        possession</strong> utility adds value by reducing reasons not to buy or by adding incentives to purchase. It is
      worth noting that the four utilities of customer value are not just limited to products; they also hold true for
      the marketing of services and are valid for both consumer and organizational buyers.</p>

    <p class="tx">The four utilities of form, time, place, and ease of possession represent what the consumer hopes to
      get out of purchasing a particular offering. All products or services that might deliver the four utilities
      adequately become part of a <strong>consideration set</strong>&#x2014;a group of alternatives that meet purchase
      criteria.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.4.2">Strategic Response: Targeting and the Marketing Mix</h2>
    <p class="tx">It is essential to understand the four utilities of customer value to develop a marketing strategy.
      The STP approach involving segmentation, targeting, and positioning is as relevant as ever to marketers, and in it
      lies the strategic response to customers&#x2019; perception of value based on the four utilities. The
      ever-increasing need to differentiate goods and services in a crowded field of competitors only increases the
      importance of selecting profitable customer segments to target, then positioning offerings in ways that appeal to
      specific segments. Consumers&#x2019; criteria for making purchase decisions represents a powerful means of
      separating them into unique segments for targeting.</p>

    <p class="tx">Once marketers have selected a market niche to target, they manipulate thousands of variables to
      design the exact offering that will stand out as the best value compared to competing offerings. These thousands
      of decisions can be grouped into four strategic areas that, taken together, make up the <strong>marketing
        mix</strong>.</p>

    <p class="tx">First popularized in the 1960s, the term <em>marketing mix</em> continues to be used to identify the
      concept of the <strong>four Ps</strong> of product, price, place, and promotion&#x2014;the controllable elements
      of a marketing strategy for any particular offering. Table 1.4 defines the four Ps of the marketing mix.</p>


    <table class="no-collapse">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="no-border" colspan="2" style="border: none">

        <tr>
          <td class="table-cell-alt"><em>Product: </em>The combination of tangible goods, services, and beliefs offered
            at a specific price.</td>
          <td class="table-cell-reg"><em>Price:</em> The amount of money or any other consideration a customer must
            exchange for the offering.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td class="table-cell-reg"><em>Place:</em> The strategy by which a company gets the right goods in the right
            quantity to the right place.</td>
          <td class="table-cell-alt"><em>Promotion:</em> The advertising and selling activity a company undertakes to
            create demand for the offering.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. The marketing mix describes the controllable elements of a product&#x2019;s
      marketing plan: decisions about product, price, place, and promotion.</p>


    <p class="tx">Product addresses the form utility, describing what makes an offering useful or, in the language of
      service-dominant logic, how it renders service. Price is driven by value, because the customer must find the price
      reasonable in exchange for the &quot;solution for sale&quot; that the product or service delivers. Place can mean
      an actual retail location, an online presence, or a distribution strategy&#x2014;and usually covers all three.
      Promotion represents the campaign development process by which the company creates demand. It defines all selling
      activity and advertising that will take place&#x2014;for example, specifying what media will be used to deliver a
      message and how it will be used to create demand. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 cover each of the four Ps in much
      greater detail.</p>

    <p class="tx">The marketing mix represents the elements of a product&#x2019;s marketing strategy that marketers can
      control&#x2014;or at least have significant input on. The product aspect is the only one of the four that springs
      from an organization&#x2019;s production function. Because most companies no longer function in a product-centric
      mode, the marketing department typically has significant impact on product design to create the form utility
      consumers want.</p>

    <p class="tx">The place aspect of marketing strategy responds to consumers&#x2019; wants in terms of time and place
      utilities, while the price aspect responds to consumers&#x2019; expectations regarding ease of possession.</p>

    <a id="p19"></a>
    <p class="tx">The marketing response to the four utilities of customer value is to develop product, place, price,
      and promotion strategies that deliver the mix that will satisfy customers in a specific target market, thus
      winning the purchase and, hopefully, creating a long-term relationship.</p>

    <p class="tx">You have now been exposed to each facet of the PVP and CVE. It should be clear how value is created by
      companies and evaluated by consumers, with the goal of making buying exchanges. You have learned how value is
      created by responding to consumers&#x2019; needs and desires, with attention to the relationship between price
      paid (sacrifice) and solution received (benefit). You have learned to see the exchange as taking possession of an
      experience, rather than a transaction about tangible goods.</p>

    <p class="tx">You have learned about the criteria by which customers evaluate the merits of various alternatives,
      using the language of the marketers&#x2019; four utilities of customer value. And finally, you have encountered
      the marketing mix and its four Ps of product, price, place, and promotion&#x2014;variables that marketers blend to
      satisfy the needs of target markets and serve organizational goals.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec1.5">1.5&#x2002;The Marketing 3.0 Landscape</h1>

    <p class="tx">As stated earlier, Philip Kotler defined three major forces at work in the Marketing 3.0 landscape:
    </p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"> consumers&#x2019; demand for participation</li>
      <li class="nl"> the globalization paradox</li>
      <li class="nl"> an increasingly creative society</li>
    </ol>

    <a id="p20"></a>
    <p class="tx">A closer look at these three factors and how they affect marketing practice will close this
      chapter&#x2019;s investigation of marketing fundamentals.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.5.1">Consumers as Business Partners</h2>
    <p class="tx">As social media becomes more pervasive, consumers are increasingly sharing their opinions about and
      experiences with companies. The influence of corporate advertising on buying behavior is diminishing as
      consumers&#x2019; ability to influence each other increases (Kotler, 2010). Marketers no longer fully control
      their brands; consumers are doing that for them.</p>

    <p class="tx">A new model of consumers as business partners is taking shape. Consumers are helping companies develop
      products, contributing ideas for advertising, and helping cocreate value as they customize goods and services to
      their individual tastes.</p>

    <p class="tx">Cocreation takes place when stakeholders (for example, a company and a group of its customers) come
      together to jointly produce a valued outcome. It can take many forms. Personalization, as when a consumer uses the
      Nike website to custom design and then order a pair of running shoes, is one form of cocreation. Collaboration,
      when customers of a company ask for specific service utility that the company then provides, is another.
      <strong>Adaptive innovation</strong> is a business approach that places cocreation at the center of a
      firm&#x2019;s various organizational functions, so that the process of collaborating with customers and offering
      personalized experiences never stops. Companies adopting this approach focus on tracking their customers&#x2019;
      evolving needs and desires, rapidly validating assumptions about innovations that would meet that demand, and
      rolling out pilots and prototypes rather than developing full-blown launches of new products or services (Nour,
      2017).</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.5.2">The Globalization Paradox</h2>
    <p class="tx">Globalization is creating a more uniform culture worldwide, increasing the speed and reach of business
      but also heightening consumers&#x2019; anxiety about the unintended consequences of the increasing homogenization
      of culture that globalization encourages. This has several implications for marketers. But first, we must
      understand what is driving this increasing globalization.</p>

    <p class="tx">Technology has contributed to the globalization of business by making possible</p>


    <ul class="bl">

      <li class="bl"> faster communications,</li>
      <li class="bl"> faster transportation, and</li>
      <li class="bl"> faster financial transactions.</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="tx">The near-instantaneous exchange of information around the globe has been one of the most dramatic
      shifts in history. Not only can we communicate anywhere, in real time, but we can also pay for and take delivery
      of goods and services (such as mobile game apps and music downloads) over the Internet. Financial transactions now
      take place in near real time as well. There is relatively little cost associated with these Internet-enabled
      transactions. All of this communication, transportation, and financial activity is available to any business, from
      the smallest craft workshop to the biggest corporation. Both consumer exchanges and business-to-business
      relationships have been dramatically reshaped by the evolution of technology and the resulting globalization.</p>

    <a id="p21"></a>
    <p class="tx">Thanks to technology, companies now do business in a marketplace without borders and with few barriers
      to entry. New markets become available due to easier and faster communication, transportation, and financial
      services&#x2014;an opportunity. But competition increases when anyone in the world can sell anywhere in the
      world&#x2014;a threat. This powerful shift leaves marketers struggling to find and maintain a competitive
      advantage in the world of Marketing 3.0. Increasingly, that competitive advantage comes from the
      <strong>authenticity</strong> of the mission, vision, and values of the company itself. Consumers seek companies
      that have a philosophical center and express commitment to humanity-centric values.</p>

    <p class="tx">When exploring global issues, ethical concerns come into play. Consider the case of quinoa. This
      grain-like Andean seed, which has been consumed for thousands of years in Colombia, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, and
      other South American countries, provides an exceptional balance of protein, fiber, and amino acids (Romaro &amp;
      Shahriari, 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">Quinoa has recently been gaining attention outside of South America. Vegetarians find it appealing
      because it offers a complete protein source. Even nonvegetarians interested in a healthy, low-fat, high-fiber,
      cholesterol-free diet are drawn to quinoa. The nutty flavor works well in any dish that typically requires grains.
      It&#x2019;s even popular as a breakfast alternative to hot oatmeal. Recognizing its market potential, European and
      American foreign aid organizations began in the 1980s to help South American farmers grow quinoa for export.</p>

    <p class="tx">So where&#x2019;s the catch? Demand for quinoa is rising rapidly in rich countries, such as the United
      States and those in the European Union. This is helping South America&#x2019;s farmers across a number of poorer
      countries. Rising exports are lifting living standards in quinoa-growing areas. But while cultivation of quinoa is
      reducing economic emigration and strengthening local families&#x2014;the price of quinoa has almost tripled over
      the past 5 years&#x2014;it&#x2019;s also robbing those families of a food staple. In many areas of South America,
      quinoa is no longer affordable for mass consumption. The balanced nutrition of quinoa is being replaced with less
      complete foodstuffs. Recent studies have shown that chronic malnutrition in children is increasing in
      quinoa-growing areas. A shift in taste preference has also begun to undermine quinoa consumption in South American
      homes, where children raised on loaves of bread and packaged noodles find quinoa unappealing. With consumers in
      America and Europe competing for quinoa, the consequences are a cause for concern (Romaro &amp; Shahriari, 2011).
      What began as a major opportunity for quinoa growers, exporters, and marketers has become a threat to the
      sustainability of the home market from which it comes.</p>

    <p class="tx">The globalization driven by faster communications, transportation, and financial transactions has
      brought new opportunities for profit&#x2014;but at a cost, as the quinoa example shows. Some companies are
      responding by operating under a new business model in which they are responsible to a <strong>triple bottom
        line</strong> of economic value, environmental health, and social progress. These firms develop and offer value
      propositions based on the inherent interconnectedness of all stakeholders in the marketplace; thus, financial
      profit cannot take priority over social or environmental impacts (Mish &amp; Scammon, 2010).</p>

    <p class="tx">Consumers&#x2019; anxieties about the effects of globalization can be addressed by companies that
      adopt an authentically ethical, values-driven business model. In fact, aligning with companies that do good in the
      world allows consumers to experience self-actualization&#x2014;thus addressing the third major force of Marketing
      3.0 identified by Kotler.</p>

    <a id="p22"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.5.3">Self-Actualization in a Creative Society</h2>
    <p class="tx">A number of contemporary authors, including Daniel Pink (<em>A Whole New Mind</em>) and Richard
      Florida (<em>The Rise of the Creative Class</em>), have offered views of the worldwide rise of a creative society.
      Creativity is playing an increasingly dominant role in society as more people are working as artists and
      scientists or in other creative professions (Kotler, 2010). A key characteristic of this new creative class of
      connected consumers is an increasing craving for meaning. In part this is possible because so many people in
      modern consumer culture are relatively affluent. For these people, self-actualization is a prime need as relevant
      as shelter, food, or security. The popularity of crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo implies
      that many people get a taste of self-actualization through supporting other people&#x2019;s creative endeavors.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">There is some debate whether this aspect of Kotler&#x2019;s Marketing 3.0 is relevant in developing
      countries, where the standard of living is not so high. Many of the markets emerging as globalization continues
      will not share the same freedom to focus on higher meaning until they, too, reach the level of affluence and
      connectivity of the fully developed world. Kotler (2010) argues that creativity and technology are relevant even
      in low-income markets. Ultimately, time will prove or disprove his belief. </p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec1.5.4">The Marketing 3.0 Response</h2>
    <p class="tx">How are marketers responding to the major forces identified with Marketing 3.0? By searching for
      authentic competitive differentiation and communicating it in ways that engage consumers, alleviate their
      anxieties about globalization, and serve the spirit as well as the mind, body, and heart. </p>

    <p class="tx">In response to consumers&#x2019; desire for participation, companies are increasingly inviting their
      collaboration in creation of advertising, discussion of brands, and customization of goods and services.</p>

    <p class="tx">Companies are adopting a business model that balances financial profit with social and environmental
      impacts, recognizing that a company is not sustainable unless all three aspects of the triple bottom line are
      neutral or positive.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing must evolve to be relevant to all aspects of the human&#x2014;mind, body, heart, and spirit
      (thus Kotler&#x2019;s use of the term <em>humanity-centric</em> to characterize Marketing 3.0). The most visible
      of marketers&#x2019; response to Marketing 3.0 expectations is the increased use of tie-ins between companies and
      causes. Many of today&#x2019;s advertising messages appeal to self-actualization by including in the pitch an
      aspect of &quot;doing good.&quot; When you see an advertiser offer to donate a percentage of sales to a charitable
      cause, you&#x2019;re seeing Marketing 3.0 in action. Such campaigns are known as <strong>cause-related
        marketing</strong>.</p>

    <p class="tx">Launched in 2015, Walgreens&#x2019; Red Nose Day provides an example of cause marketing used to
      respond to consumers&#x2019; desire for meaningful engagement. In this program, consumers show their support for
      ending child poverty by purchasing a Red Nose for $1. During the annual Red Nose campaign, Walgreens donates 50
      cents of each Red Nose purchase to the Red Nose Day Fund, which supports programs that help children living in
      poverty in the United States and internationally. Through these campaigns, purchases that fill fairly basic needs
      (food and health products) are elevated to meaningful charitable acts that satisfy a higher need (Walgreens,
      2017).</p>

    <a id="p23"></a>
    <p class="tx">But &quot;doing good&quot; can be more than a marketing theme, as discussed earlier regarding the
      triple bottom line. Businesses are &quot;baking into&quot; their business model the well-being of people and the
      planet. John Mackey, founder and co-CEO of Whole Foods Market, says, &quot;Just as people cannot live without
      eating, so a business cannot live without profits. But most people don&#x2019;t live to eat, and neither must
      businesses live just to make profits&quot; (Mackey &amp; Sisodia 2013, p. xii).</p>

    <p class="tx">The key insight of Marketing 3.0&#x2014;that customers are collaborative partners&#x2014;demands that,
      above all, companies be authentic. They must hold a vision, mission, and values consistent with their brand,
      position, and competitive differentiation. Customers will accept nothing less. These marketing responses answer
      the three major forces Kotler identifies.</p>

    <h2 class="Case-Study h2" id="ch01casestudy"><strong>Case Study: </strong><em>The Craft Beer Movement</em></h2>

    <p class="tx">There&#x2019;s a revolution going on in America&#x2019;s beer industry. An underdog category is
      challenging the dominant brands in the beer aisle. Consumer tastes are driving remarkable growth in a category
      called &quot;craft beer,&quot; a term that refers to the handcrafted, small-batch quality of its manufacture. This
      shift in consumer taste presents an opportunity to consider the marketing fundamentals discussed in this chapter.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Consumers interested in the quality of the beer they drink represent a market distinct from the
      mass-market drinkers who focus on quantity and want &quot;beer you can drink more of.&quot; The craft beer drinker
      focuses on the distinct flavor and body of various beer styles. Consumption usually amounts to savoring one or two
      beverages, taking time to appreciate the unique properties of each. This revolution focuses on a very different
      consumer, and different marketing strategies are needed.</p>

    <p class="tx">This case study investigates the marketing of craft beers, using the example of the New Albanian
      Brewing Company (NABC) in New Albany, Indiana. (The NABC tagline is &quot;Brewing ahead of the curve.&quot;) This
      company, located just outside Louisville, Kentucky, has chosen to stand out by striking an attitude. Right from
      the start, the brand&#x2019;s images and messages drew heavily on the propaganda symbols and rhetoric of the
      Russian Revolution of the early 20th century. Owner Roger Baylor&#x2019;s blog reminds readers that beer is
      &quot;far too important to be left to the unreconstructed swillocrats&quot; (Potable Curmudgeon, 2012). The
      company refers to its distributors (tavern owners) as &quot;publicanistas&quot; (Potable Curmudgeon, 2012). They
      sell to a regional market that includes Jefferson County, Kentucky, and the entire state of Indiana. For more
      information, visit the NABC website, <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://www.newalbanian.com/">http://newalbanian.com</a>, or Baylor&#x2019;s blog, at <a class="link"
        target="_blank" href="http://potablecurmudgeon.blogspot.com/">http://potablecurmudgeon.blogspot.com</a>.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider the four utilities of customer value as they apply to this brand of craft beer. How does a
      bottle (or can or glass) of craft beer deliver value to meet potential buyers&#x2019; purchase criteria, when
      compared with mass-market beers?</p>

    <p class="tx">Form</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"> higher quality ingredients</li>
      <li class="bl"> strong brand identity communicated through packaging, advertising, and social media</li>
      <li class="bl"> artisanal craftsmanship</li>
      <li class="bl"> more flavor</li>
      <li class="bl"> fewer or no preservatives and additives</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="tx">Time</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"> fresh product meant to be consumed promptly (because most contain no preservatives)</li>
      <li class="bl"> bottles, growlers, and kegs allow the product to travel</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="tx">Place</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"> difficulty getting distribution (distributors, required by liquor laws, are predisposed toward
        mass-market brewers)</li>
      <li class="bl"> <a id="p25"></a>competition with many brands for a place among a tavern&#x2019;s tap lines (where
        the number of lines is typically limited to 6&#x2013;12 taps)</li>
      <li class="bl"> expanding availability through local retailers (more convenience stores now carry craft beers)
      </li>
      <li class="bl"> mail order available in some states where permitted by law</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="tx">Ease of possession</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"> must be of legal drinking age</li>
      <li class="bl"> premium price makes trying a craft beer a greater risk (cost is often twice that of mass-market
        products)</li>
      <li class="bl"> attractive to consumers interested in the &quot;buy-local&quot; movement</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="tx">The NABC must find ways to differentiate its beers from those of competitors by manipulating these
      four aspects of customer value to its advantage.</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Form:</em> The NABC has begun packaging selected beers in 22-ounce bottles (called
      &quot;bombers&quot;). On the blog, founder and &quot;carnival barker&quot; Roger Baylor states,
      &quot;NABC&#x2019;s decision to package beer in bombers reflects our preference for the communal utility of the
      size. Bombers contain two or more servings of beer, ideal for sharing among friends&quot; (Potable Curmudgeon,
      2012).</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Time:</em> The NABC sells through its own brewpubs in two locations, delivering the freshest
      possible beer to consumers. Fans of the NABC&#x2019;s fresh-brewed products can purchase &quot;take-out beer&quot;
      in growlers (half-gallon reusable bottles) and 50-liter kegs. Bottles are also available.</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Place:</em> The NABC leverages its Russian Revolution&#x2013;inspired brand identity to stand out
      both in its brewpub locations and on retailers&#x2019; shelves. A visitor to the RateBeer website commented on the
      brewpub, &quot;I love this place. One side pizza sports bar, and the other side makes you feel like you&#x2019;re
      an American spy infiltrating a popular bar of the former USSR (except this bar has beer and not vodka).&quot; On
      retailers&#x2019; shelves, the distinctive label designs compete for attention. (The NABC blog carries the slogan
      &quot;Think Globally, Drink Locally&#x2014;Indiana Beer&quot; [as cited in Potable Curmudgeon, 2012]).</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Ease of possession:</em> No craft beers&#x2014;or any beers, for that matter&#x2014;come with a
      warranty or payment plan. The premium price of craft beer functions as both a mark of premium quality and a
      barrier to checking out an unknown brand. The NABC, like other craft brewers, participates in many beer festivals
      and tasting events and offers free samples in its restaurants to help consumers make a choice.</p>

    <p class="tx">Imagine you are in charge of marketing for the NABC as you consider the following questions.</p>

    <ul class="bl">

      <li class="bl"> The history of marketing thought can be summarized in four time periods: the production era, the
        sales era, the marketing era, and the relationship era.</li>
      <li class="bl"> Philip Kotler envisions a coming era of humanity-centric marketing, characterized as Marketing
        3.0, that is fundamentally different from previous eras of product-centric and consumer-centric thought and
        practice.</li>
      <li class="bl"> Firms offer value propositions for their product (goods or service). PVP = Quality + Service +
        Price of product</li>
      <li class="bl"> Consumers assign a monetary value to the benefits and sacrifices represented by a potential
        purchase, which is termed the CVE.</li>
      <li class="bl"> Consumers develop criteria to determine value based on the service or utility the goods or
        services will deliver, which can be assigned to four categories; the four utilities of customer value include
        form, time, place, and ease of possession; marketers respond with marketing mix strategies concerning product,
        place, price, and promotion.</li>
      <li class="bl"> Kotler&#x2019;s Marketing 3.0 is characterized by consumers&#x2019; demand for engagement and
        collaboration, by the globalization paradox, and by the drive for self-actualization.</li>

      <li class="nl"> What can today&#x2019;s marketers learn from the marketing responses for the four eras in the
        history of marketing as defined by David L. Kurtz?</li>
      <li class="nl"> How does Philip Kotler&#x2019;s proposed framework of Marketing 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 resemble or
        differ from the previous framework attributed to Kurtz?</li>
      <li class="nl"> Drawing on your own experience, give an example that demonstrates how value is interactive,
        conditional, relativistic, and dynamic.</li>
      <li class="nl"> Do you agree with the statement that &quot;all markets are centered on the exchange of services,
        and all economies and societies are service based&quot;? Consider a recent purchase of a product; describe it in
        terms of service rendered by the object purchased.</li>
      <li class="nl"> When is a customer not a consumer? Consider the settings in which the purchaser of an item is not
        the person who uses or consumes it. Name two situations in which the purchaser of an item is not the end user.
        (Clue: Think about how parents shop for their children or how purchasing agents operate within businesses.)</li>
      <li class="nl"> Why is the concept of utility so important in marketing thought?</li>
      <li class="nl"> It has been stated that marketers no longer fully control their brands. For example, a couple
        planning a trip to London is now more likely to book a hotel, choose restaurants, and plan sightseeing using
        online reviews from travelers like themselves than to gather ideas from advertising or professional travel
        agents. Give another example of how consumers are taking over the role of marketers.</li>
      <li class="nl"> Evaluate the concept of the triple bottom line of economic value, environmental health, and social
        progress. Is it feasible for companies to hold themselves to this standard in a tight economy or a highly
        competitive situation?</li>

    <h1 class="h1" id="ch02intro">Introduction</h1>



    <p class="tx">Today&#x2019;s business is a humanity-centric endeavor that contributes to sustaining and improving
      the world and invites customers into collaboration to create the value they seek. What is the role of the
      marketing department in this new paradigm? </p>

    <p class="tx">In this chapter we&#x2019;ll put marketing in context of the business processes that support the
      execution of a company&#x2019;s strategic plans. Then we will narrow our focus to the marketing process&#x2014;the
      series of logical steps carried out by corporate marketing departments and others in an organization, based on
      sound business planning. Sequential steps of analysis, marketing strategy, campaign development, execution, and
      measurement make up the marketing process. Throughout upcoming chapters, you&#x2019;ll build on these fundamental
      process concepts to gain a deeper understanding of what marketing involves. In Chapter 9 we&#x2019;ll return to
      this marketing process, with a focus on how it is managed to achieve integration across the dozens (even hundreds)
      of functional units that contribute to marketing, inside and outside a company.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec2.1">2.1&#x2002;Putting Marketing in Context</h1>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Macro marketing</strong> is the largest framework relevant to our discussion&#x2014;the effect
      that companies&#x2019; marketing activities, institutions, and processes have on the world at large. Macro
      marketing concerns the social process that directs the flow of an economy&#x2019;s goods and services from
      producer to consumer, with a goal of meeting demand with supply and accomplishing the objectives of that social
      system. In other words, macro marketing concerns the system that determines what and how much is to be produced;
      how it is distributed; and who produces it, for whom, and by when (Perreault, Cannon, &amp; McCarthy, 2015).</p>

    <p class="tx">Here the role of <strong>corporate social responsibility (CSR)</strong> comes into play. Where is that
      flow humanity-centric&#x2014;that is, beneficial to society, or at least harm-free, in terms of its resource
      consumption, human impact, and environmental (ecological) effects? We cannot and should not ignore macro
      marketing, because in the interconnected world of our market-driven system, broad populations have a stake in the
      outcomes of choices that companies and consumers make (Perreault et al., 2015). The macro marketing frame requires
      marketing managers to do their best to select strategies and processes that improve positive effects and reduce
      negative effects on people and the planet.</p>

    <p class="tx">Within that macro frame, individual companies operate. Marketing decision makers undertake activities
      designed to sense customer needs and wants, then choose strategies that satisfy them. This <strong>micro
        marketing</strong> frame is the focus of this course&#x2014;how individuals in organizations decide the
      strategies and conduct the processes of the marketing function. </p>

    <p class="tx">The marketing function is just one component of business activity. Additional functions include
      accounting, human resources, and information technology, among others. Within each department, groups of
      specialists create value for the organization.</p>

    <a id="p33"></a>
    <p class="tx">By their very nature most departments are focused inward, creating value (for instance, producing
      quarterly financial statements or installing new computers) without contact with customers or competitors.
      Marketing departments, on the other hand, naturally focus outward and thus play a key role in keeping the
      organization alert to its customers, competitors, and other actors and forces in the marketing environment. (The
      marketing environment is the topic of Chapter 8.)</p>

    <p class="tx">All that activity requires coordination, so businesses have managers. <strong>Business
        management</strong> involves planning, organizing, leading, controlling, and monitoring activity. These
      functions take place within each department, coordinated by the organization&#x2019;s overall strategic direction.
      Each department occupies a specific place on the organizational chart and operates under the oversight of a
      manager. Companies vary in the number of layers of management between frontline contributors and the senior
      leaders who set strategy and are responsible to shareholders for financial performance.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.1.1">Strategic Planning</h2>
    <p class="tx">Where does this company-wide strategic plan that sets direction for every department come from? What
      process generates it? <strong>Strategic planning</strong> is itself a business process not unlike the marketing
      process. But the strategic planning process drives all other business processes. In strategic planning, an
      organization selects an overall direction.</p>

    <p class="tx">The strategic planning process calls for top-level executives and other <strong>stakeholders</strong>
      in a business (such as customers, board members, employees, creditors, and suppliers) to examine its current
      status and relevant trends to decide on a <strong>mission</strong> and <strong>vision</strong> that reflect the
      purpose it envisions for itself in society&#x2014;producing profits, performing a charitable function, meeting the
      needs of members or owners, or serving some other goal. Every organization, no matter its function, exists because
      of its founders&#x2019; authentic commitment to a purpose. With that purpose as its &#x201C;North Star&#x201D; to
      steer toward, planners set long-term objectives, devise strategies and tactics to achieve those objectives, and
      summarize all those decisions in a strategic plan document. </p>

    <p class="tx">The company-wide strategic plan defines the role and goal for every department, which must be
      translated into departmental objectives. Strategies developed within each department will support these
      overarching goals. Each department&#x2019;s manager takes direction from a component of the plan that specifies
      the objectives for which he or she is responsible and accountable. </p>

    <p class="tx">The company&#x2019;s strategic plan determines how it will deploy resources in each of its functions,
      from innovation and marketing to operations, human resources, and finances. Most large firms carry out a
      formalized, top-down strategic planning process on a regular cycle, usually every year. Many other companies,
      including those in start-up mode and businesses going through transitions such as a merger or change of
      leadership, also do formal strategic planning.</p>

    <a id="p34"></a>
    <p class="tx">Can you visualize yourself in a seat in a marketing department within a company, your day-to-day
      experience affected by its organizational culture, your to-do list dictated by execution of its departmental
      strategy? Your seat could be in a company as small as the first Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s scoop shop in a renovated
      gas station in South Burlington, Vermont, or in a multinational like Unilever, which today owns the Ben &amp;
      Jerry&#x2019;s brand. Regardless of the size of the organization around you, corporate strategy defines your
      experience in the micro marketing frame and functions within the macro marketing frame.</p>

    <p class="tx">The marketing department is in a unique position in relation to strategic planning, because it alone
      is equally knowledgeable about consumers&#x2019; behavior and needs and the strengths and weaknesses of the
      company itself. In some organizations, the marketing department will have the power to set strategy for other
      departments. In all organizations, marketers stand at the gateway between consumer and producer, helping each
      understand the other&#x2019;s needs and wants. The marketing process is the means by which the marketing
      department drives the whole organization to encourage buying exchanges.</p>

    <p class="tx">Strategic planning guides designing the business portfolio and selecting a growth strategy, our next
      topics.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.1.2">Designing the Business Portfolio</h2>
    <p class="tx">Most companies are made up of a collection of goods and/or service lines. Each line may be at a
      different stage in its product life cycle; each may be facing different forces in the marketing environment. Taken
      together, these lines make up the <strong>business portfolio</strong> of the organization. Within the business
      portfolio are <strong>strategic business units (SBUs)</strong>, each of which will be treated as a separate
      investment, responsible for returning profit to the company. The multinational company Unilever, for example, has
      an SBU that consists of several frozen treat product lines aimed at different market niches, including Ben &amp;
      Jerry&#x2019;s, Breyers, and Good Humor, among others. </p>

    <p class="tx">Depending on a company&#x2019;s internal organization, an SBU can consist of a single product, a
      product line or brand, or even an autonomous company owned by the parent organization. Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s is
      an interesting hybrid in that its economic mission is controlled by Unilever but its product quality and social
      mission are controlled by the independent board of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s (Edmondson, 2014). </p>

    <p class="tx">If a company is sufficiently complex, it may organize itself around product groups (associated items
      that consumers might use together, or think of as similar) within the business portfolio. Unilever, for example,
      is organized into three separate units that control its product groups for food and drink, home care, and personal
      care products. Within its food and drink unit are separate subunits organized to provide all the functions
      required to produce and market different product lines. Each develops its own corporate strategy but takes
      direction from the parent company. </p>


    <a id="p35"></a>
    <p class="tx">The full collection of items offered by the company is referred to as its <strong>product
        mix</strong>, or assortment (see Figure 2.1).</p>


    <div class="figure-box">
      <h4 class="figure-name">Figure 2.1: Relationships among a company&#x2019;s offerings</h4>
      <h5 class="figure-title">The product assortment is made up of product lines, to which individual items are
        assigned.</h5>

        title="Diagram of relationships among a company&#x2019;s offerings." class="figure" id="fig_2.1">
    </div>

    <p class="tx">No matter the size or organizational structure of a firm, business portfolio planning requires first
      analyzing the current portfolio to determine how much support each SBU deserves. Then planners must decide what
      the future portfolio should be.</p>

    <p class="tx">The ideal business portfolio reflects the company&#x2019;s strengths and leverages opportunities in
      the marketing environment. To achieve healthy cash flow over both the short and long term, a company&#x2019;s
      portfolio should have some products that are growing faster than others and some that have a greater
      <strong>market share</strong> than others.</p>

    <p class="tx">A widely taught method for analysis of the business portfolio is the <strong>BCG Matrix</strong>,
      originally developed by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in the 1960s (Boston Consulting Group, 2011). This
      growth/share matrix (shown in Figure 2.2) assigns SBUs to one of four quadrants based on the amount of cash each
      generates or requires. The BCG Matrix is also known as the BCG growth/share matrix or, simply, the Boston Box. In
      the BCG Matrix, each SBU is represented by a circle that differs in size by sales volume.</p>


    <a id="p36"></a>
    <div class="figure-box">
      <h4 class="figure-name">Figure 2.2: Hypothetical BCG Matrix</h4>
      <h5 class="figure-title">The BCG Matrix assesses market growth rate and relative market share for strategic
        business units by visualizing the relative market share of products and the growth of their market. The BCG
        Matrix shown represents hypothetical drug brands.</h5>

            Group.</em></strong></p>
    </div>


    <p class="tx">The quadrants are defined as:</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><em>Stars:</em> High-growth, high-share SBUs that generate cash flow but also require significant
        investment to finance their growth.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Cash cows:</em> Low-growth, high-share SBUs that produce cash flow while requiring little
        investment to hold their market share.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Question marks:</em> High-growth but low-share SBUs that require investment to hold their
        place; increasing their share will require even more cash&#x2014;a gamble.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Dogs:</em> Low-growth, low-share SBUs that generate enough cash flow to be self-sustaining but
        show little promise of moving toward higher share or growth rate.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Cash cows provide the cash flow that covers a company&#x2019;s overhead and allows it to invest
      resources in other SBUs. Stars, dogs, and question marks require investment before they will provide
      cash&#x2014;if they ever will. But without some stars and question marks in development, the company will have
      nothing to replace a cash cow when it reaches the end of its product life cycle.</p>

    <p class="tx">Once strategic planners have assigned their SBUs to quadrants in the BCG Matrix, they must forecast
      what role each will play going forward. Depending on the SBU&#x2019;s role, planners choose a strategy: build up
      the SBU with an investment of resources, hold steady, harvest short-term profits while planning for divestment, or
      phase it out completely. The tools of portfolio analysis, such as the BCG Matrix, are equally applicable to
      product strategy.</p>


    <a id="p37"></a>
    <p class="tx">The connection between the BCG Matrix and marketing strategy should thus be clear: Stars and cash cows
      are likely to receive more marketing support than question marks and dogs. </p>

    <p class="tx">The BCG Matrix is useful to select strategies that balance exploitation of mature SBUs while exploring
      the new opportunities that will fuel future growth. There are, however, problems with the BCG Matrix:</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">It can be difficult to adequately define SBUs in terms of their market share and growth in order to
        assign them to the appropriate quadrants. Unless planners also predict a direction of movement for each SBU, the
        matrix provides little insight into the future. Product life cycles and the effect of diffusion of innovation
        (subjects that will be discussed in Chapter 3) must be taken into account. </li>
      <li class="bl">A product&#x2019;s future does not unfold in a vacuum. Planners would be well advised to consider
        competitors&#x2019; SBUs&#x2014;but gathering the needed information about competitors can be difficult.</li>
      <li class="bl">The matrix implies that relative market-share growth and increased growth rate are the most
        important strategic goals, while failing to hint at the difficulty of achieving those goals. Businesses can
        easily be drawn into new areas they do not know how to manage. </li>
      <li class="bl">Circumstances change more swiftly and unpredictably than in the past. SBUs move within and across
        the quadrants more rapidly. Companies must be capable of agile response, which means reconsidering the BCG
        Matrix more frequently.</li>
      <li class="bl">The matrix takes into account only the traditional measures of performance that impact profits:
        market growth and relative market share. In a humanity-centric marketplace, other measures may be just as
        relevant. </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">To avoid problems, marketing planning teams should include managers who have frequent contact with
      customers and suppliers. Strategic experiments should be developed that allow adaptation before rolling out fully
      developed strategies. Planners should blend insights from the BCG Matrix with other, more detailed planning based
      on their specific situations and should bear in mind the triple bottom line&#x2014;that impact of strategy
      decisions on people and the planet, as well as profits.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.1.3">Selecting a Growth Strategy</h2>
    <p class="tx">While all departments in an organization contribute to creating value for customers, marketers hold
      the responsibility for achieving profitable growth for the company. Only the marketing department can identify,
      assess, and select which market opportunities to pursue and&#xA0;how.</p>

    <p class="tx">A tool that helps marketers identify growth strategies is Ansoff&#x2019;s Matrix, shown in Table 2.1.
      Like the BCG Matrix, this matrix aids planners in developing alternatives from which to choose a strategy.
      Ansoff&#x2019;s Matrix assesses the potential for increasing sales via four market&#x2013;product strategies:</p>

    <a id="p38"></a>
    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"> <em>Market penetration:</em> A strategy to increase sales of current products to current markets;
        no change in either the product line or the market segment served is required.</li>
      <li class="nl"> <em>Product development:</em> A strategy of selling new or modified products to current markets;
        this requires innovation in the product line.</li>
      <li class="nl"> <em>Market development:</em> A strategy of selling current products to new market segments; this
        requires identifying new markets to serve.</li>
      <li class="nl"> <em>Diversification:</em> A strategy of developing new or modified products and selling them to
        new markets; this may be achieved through product innovation or through acquiring new businesses to obtain their
        product lines.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. Four market&#x2013;product strategies present alternatives for growth
      opportunities.</p>

    <p class="tx">Diversification is the riskiest of the strategies proposed by Ansoff&#x2019;s Matrix. Like the
      question marks of the BCG Matrix, investing in diversification can lead companies into areas in which they lack
      the necessary production or marketing expertise.</p>

    <p class="tx">Ansoff&#x2019;s Matrix suggests strategies for growth, but downsizing or divestment of SBUs are also
      options. There are many reasons a company might want to cease investing in some of its products or brands. A
      company might want to weed out lines that create losses or are marginally profitable or to respond to changes in
      the marketing environment.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider how application of the BCG Matrix and Ansoff&#x2019;s Matrix might guide strategic planning
      for Kellogg&#x2019;s, the multinational food manufacturing company. Kellogg&#x2019;s produces ready-to-eat cereals
      and convenience foods, including cookies, crackers, savory snacks, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored
      snacks, frozen waffles, and vegetarian foods, which are manufactured in 21 countries and marketed in over 180
      countries to the grocery trade. The cereal products are marketed under the Kellogg&#x2019;s name. The cookies,
      crackers, chips, and other convenience food brands joined the Kellogg family through acquisition and are generally
      marketed under their brand names, such as Keebler, Cheez-It, Famous Amos, and Pringles. The health food products,
      also acquired brands, include Kashi and Morningstar Farms (Kellogg Company, 2017). </p>

    <p class="tx">Which of these products are the stars, cash cows, question marks, and dogs of the Kellogg&#x2019;s
      portfolio? Which deserve a growth strategy, and which might best be phased out? If growth is promising, which of
      the four strategies suggested by Ansoff&#x2019;s Matrix might work best? Without a seat in the Kellogg&#x2019;s
      boardroom, we cannot know, but study of Kellogg&#x2019;s product line, annual report, and other publicly available
      information provides details on which a strategic plan could be based. The links in <em>Field Trip 2.1</em> offer
      a starting point.</p>

    <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s consider the categories U.S. Morning Foods and U.S. Snacks, drawing from the
      company&#x2019;s 2016 annual report. From steady sales volume among the core six brands, one might conclude the
      cash cow of Kellogg&#x2019;s breakfast and snack foods would be its cereal category. Likewise, toaster pastries
      reported modest net sales and share gains.</p>

    <a id="p39"></a>
    <p class="tx">The stars appear to be the crackers, which posted sales and share growth, driven in part by innovation
      in Pringles on-the-go packs.</p>

    <p class="tx">The dogs of Kellogg&#x2019;s are its bars. That business declined, dragged down by the Special K diet
      bar, due to changes in dieting trends away from counting calories. Offsetting that trend was the success of
      Protein Trail Mix bars, Fruit and Nut bars, Rice Krispies Treats, and Nutri-Grain. This highlights a fault of the
      BCG Matrix&#x2014;the difficulty of defining SBUs. Lumped into Kellogg&#x2019;s SBU &#x201C;bars&#x201D; category
      are products at different points in their product life cycles, a significant factor that is masked by aggregating
      them into one unit.</p>

    <p class="tx">The question mark of Kellogg&#x2019;s SBUs is its latest entrant&#x2014;Special K Nourish cereal with
      probiotics, launched in August 2017. Kellogg&#x2019;s also plans to position Special K, Mini-Wheats, and Raisin
      Bran brands around a growing interest in gut health. How will this new SBU of &#x201C;intestinal health
      products&#x201D; fare?</p>

    <p class="tx">Paul Norman, president of Kellogg North America, discussed the launch during a conference call with
      investment analysts in August 2017. He described recent market developments that led to this strategy: </p>

    <p class="ext">Low calorie, low fat has come off trend, and we have obviously been impacted significantly by that.
      What encourages me as I look forward in where science and nutrition is going and where the trends are . . . really
      important is gut health and the gut&#x2013;brain connection, the importance of the microbiome. (as cited in
      Watrous, 2017, para. 6) </p>

    <p class="tx">According to Norman, Kellogg&#x2019;s is confident in the new SBU: &#x201C;The big wins will come from
      . . . driving innovation into our adult brands, things like Special K with probiotics, etc., as we go
      forward&#x201D; (as cited in Watrous, 2017, para. 7).</p>

    <p class="tx">Applying Ansoff&#x2019;s Matrix to evaluate growth strategies, we might develop a plan for
      Kellogg&#x2019;s that emphasizes market penetration for its cash cows at the breakfast table, with a market
      development strategy for the crackers, perhaps investing in advertising to promote the grab-and-go benefit of its
      convenience packaging. A product development strategy will likely be deployed to introduce the new Special K
      Nourish and similar &#x201C;gut health&#x201D; products into current markets.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.1.4">Organization of the Marketing Department </h2>
    <p class="tx">We began this discussion of marketing in the context of the macro marketing view of companies&#x2019;
      effect on people and the planet, then narrowed to the micro marketing lens. We introduced the departmental
      relationships within a company to understand how corporate strategies are selected that marketing departments must
      execute. Because contributing to those decisions is a key function of the marketing department, we looked at
      frameworks for making strategic decisions. We now return to this organizational schema, zooming in further to
      consider what goes on in those marketing departments.</p>

    <p class="tx">Depending on the size of the organization, the marketing department might consist of just a few people
      covering a wide range of functions, or numerous specialists focusing on specific aspects of research, selling,
      advertising, customer service, and more. Some marketing departments organize around functions, while others
      organize around geographic territories, brands and product lines, customer markets, or some combination that
      ensures that each facet of marketing is strategically managed. In the relationship-oriented world of Marketing
      3.0, organizing the marketing function around customer relationship management (CRM) has become increasingly
      common; CRM emphasizes identification and satisfaction of customers&#x2019; needs and wants, supported by a data
      gathering and analytic processes for maintaining relationships with the best mix of customers. It reflects
      <strong>market orientation</strong>, a business approach that (consistent with the marketing concept discussed in
      Chapter 1) focuses the entire organization on three pillars&#x2014;customer focus, coordinated marketing, and
      profitability (Kohli &amp; Jaworski, 1990).</p>

    <p class="tx">A market orientation gives the marketing department considerable influence over other departments.
      Firms with a market orientation find it easier to adopt an <strong>integrated marketing communications
        (IMC)</strong> approach, which focuses on managing customer relationships over time by linking all initiatives
      related to brand communications so that audiences encounter a consistent message across all channels (a subject
      addressed in Chapter 9). Failure to make a market orientation part of an organization&#x2019;s values will likely
      have a negative effect on the company&#x2019;s performance.</p>

    <p class="tx">The marketing department has its own roles and reporting lines, and it has relationships with internal
      and external partners. (Internal partners are employed by the company, while external partners are linked to it by
      other relationships, such as a service contract or seat on the board of directors.) In a market-oriented
      organization, the company groups in the micro environment must be informed about, and aligned with, marketing
      initiatives. So should service providers to the organization&#x2019;s marketing function, such as ad agencies,
      vendors, and other channel partners. The marketing department must &#x201C;sell&#x201D; the value of a market
      orientation to all stakeholders with potential to either positively or negatively affect value creation and the
      customer experience.</p>

    <p class="tx">To summarize the elements of marketing discussed thus far: Marketing takes place in a context of
      business strategy, which takes place in the framework of macro marketing. The marketing department works with
      assessments of current performance and growth strategies developed at the highest corporate level using planning
      tools such as the BCG Matrix and Ansoff&#x2019;s Matrix. The BCG Matrix contributes to understanding SBUs in terms
      of resource allocation; Ansoff&#x2019;s Matrix contributes to strategy development. Within the corporate
      framework, marketing organizes its departmental functions and strategic goals to maximize profits while
      emphasizing a market orientation throughout all stakeholder groups, inside and outside the company.</p>

    <a id="p41"></a>
    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Given that marketing departments function within their organization&#x2019;s overall corporate
        strategy, how influential can they be? If senior managers do not show commitment to the market orientation, what
        alternatives can the marketing department pursue to do its best&#xA0;work?</p>

      <p class="tx">Why are the high-growth but low-share SBUs in a company&#x2019;s business portfolio
        called&#xA0;question marks? What questions do products in this quadrant raise?</p>
    </div>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.1.5">Steps in the Marketing Process</h2>
    <p class="tx">Simply put, the marketing process consists of a cycle of logical steps to determine what to do, decide
      how to do it, and measure how it worked out, in order to determine what to do next. The rest of this chapter will
      explore that cycle.</p>

    <p class="tx">The marketing process involves situation analysis, selection of a marketing strategy, and development
      of a campaign, followed by execution and measurement. Figure 2.3 presents the marketing process as a series of
      steps. It should be noted that the first two steps are likely to be interactive&#x2014;what is learned in the
      second step frequently calls for revisiting the first step to find out more. The whole marketing process is
      iterative, meaning that once finished, it begins again to refine, expand, or change the strategy. Each iteration
      reacts to how the situation has changed since the previous iteration.</p>


    <a id="p42"></a>
    <p class="tx">The marketing process helps a business select and attract a customer, make the sale, and please the
      customer to such an extent that he or she returns and makes referrals. This isn&#x2019;t going to happen without
      thoughtful planning, so that&#x2019;s where the marketing process begins. To avoid confusing this planning step of
      the marketing process with strategic planning, remember that the strategic plan comes first. Everything marketers
      do throughout the marketing process responds to objectives laid out in the company&#x2019;s strategic plan.</p>

        src="images/2.1.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Associated Press</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">Even a microbusiness like a food truck benefits from performing a situation analysis to
        find a good match between the company&#x2019;s strengths and potential customers&#x2019; needs.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Given our definition of the first step in the marketing process as &#x201C;determining what to
      do,&#x201D; the process necessarily begins with <strong>situation analysis</strong>, because information about
      what is happening inside and around a company is essential to decisions about what to do. The situation analysis
      asks the question &#x201C;What is happening?&#x201D; and then answers it in enough detail to allow marketers to
      develop a hypothesis about what actions they could take. Because the marketing process must lead to reasonable
      hypotheses, it requires insight at many levels, including the <strong>macro environment</strong>, the
      <strong>micro environment</strong>, and the target market. Factors in the macro environment include
      society/culture, technology, ecology, the economic and political landscape, and the regulatory climate in every
      market in which the company conducts or plans to conduct business. The micro environment consists of factors
      specifically affecting the company doing the planning&#x2014;its industry, competitors, and operations. The target
      market concerns the company&#x2019;s current and potential customers.</p>

    <a id="p43"></a>
    <p class="tx">Situation analysis requires systematic information gathering, followed by examination and evaluation,
      to identify all relevant data and thus uncover meaningful interrelationships. Done properly, situation analysis
      guides marketers toward strategies that maximize the fit between the organization&#x2019;s goals and capabilities
      and emerging marketing opportunities.</p>

    <p class="tx">Several analytic tools are discussed here that provide inputs to that choice. Like the marketing
      process itself, these tools are interactive and iterative; what is learned from one type of analysis might create
      a need to conduct more analysis of a different kind.</p>

    <p class="tx">Note that any marketing objective selected in this step should first of all be achievable. The
      marketing department is accountable to the organization as a whole, and it will function best when focused on
      goals it can reasonably expect to accomplish. This is a persuasive reason to give this first step in the marketing
      process the attention it deserves. </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.2.1">Environmental Analysis</h2>
    <p class="tx">An environmental analysis helps marketers identify an opportunity to fill an unmet customer need or to
      improve on how competitors&#x2019; products fill a need. Chapter 8 is essential reading related to environmental
      analysis, with its focus on the marketing environment. </p>

    <p class="tx">Finding an achievable strategy based on a meaningful competitive advantage is the key reason for
      undertaking an environmental analysis. Every company has strengths that make some opportunities more likely to
      generate success than others. A food truck entrepreneur is more likely to move on an opportunity to open a small
      restaurant than to open a bicycle repair shop someday. But opportunities arise from customers&#x2019; unmet or
      poorly met needs, not from entrepreneurs&#x2019; ambitions. When a company finds it is uniquely suited to deliver
      a product or service, or it has identified a means to deliver better value than existing offerings, it has
      discovered a strategic competitive advantage. A food truck entrepreneur who learns her customers care deeply about
      the environment might deploy a fleet of cargo bikes as sales vehicles more suited to its customers&#x2019;
      humanity-centric orientation and thus gain a competitive advantage.</p>

    <p class="tx">Performing an environmental analysis requires looking both inward and outward&#x2014;spending time
      reflecting on what the company is oriented to do well and studying what in the environment might help or hinder
      the company. In the language of business planning, marketers must conduct <strong>internal analysis</strong> and
      <strong>external analysis</strong>. </p>

    <p class="tx">Internal analysis focuses on inherent capacities of the organization, while external analysis focuses
      on contextual factors. Internal analysis looks at a company in terms of its story&#x2014;where it began, how it
      reached its current state of operations, what that present state is like, and what plans are made for the future
      of the organization. Internal analysis focuses on factors inherent to the organization that give it advantages or
      disadvantages in meeting the needs of its target customers. External analysis, on the other hand, focuses on the
      environment surrounding the company, including both the micro environment (factors specifically affecting this
      company) and the macro environment (factors affecting many companies). All the micro and macro environmental
      factors should be assessed in the external analysis (see Figure 2.4).</p>

      <h4 class="figure-name">Figure 2.4: Framework for situation analysis</h4>

    <p class="tx">Each focus of the environmental analysis&#x2014;external and internal&#x2014;has potential to reveal
      challenges and opportunities that can then be used in a SWOT analysis. </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.2.2">SWOT Analysis</h2>
    <p class="tx">Like the environmental analysis, the <strong>SWOT analysis</strong> is a key tool in both strategic
      planning and the marketing process. The SWOT analysis takes the factors identified by the environmental analysis
      and examines their potential for positive or negative impact. This framework for analyzing internal and external
      forces affecting the business either positively or negatively is depicted in Table 2.2. The acronym derives from
      strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider the example of Pulling Down the Moon, a Chicago-based service providing yoga classes,
      acupuncture, massage therapy, and nutritional counseling to women undergoing fertility treatments. The company,
      founded in 2002, had four offices in the Chicago area and one outside Washington, D.C., by 2011.</p>

    <p class="tx">In 2004 cofounders Beth Heller and Tami Quinn opened an office in downtown Chicago near one of the
      nation&#x2019;s largest fertility clinics, to make referrals and appointments easy and thus capture a stream of
      clients. Fertility Centers of Illinois agreed to sublease to the entrepreneurs a studio on the ground floor along
      Chicago&#x2019;s Riverwalk. All went well&#x2014;until in July 2010 a flood damaged the first floor. The company
      relocated temporarily. Its landlord, the fertility center, decided to use the occasion to undergo a total redesign
      of its space, adding months before Pulling Down the Moon could return to permanent quarters.</p>

    <p class="tx">Just 1 day before the anniversary of that first flood, another flood sent water into the building.
      Damage was moderate enough that Pulling Down the Moon was able to stay in place while restoration work was done,
      but the threat posed by the riverfront location was clearer than ever (Grossmann, 2011a).</p>

      After the second flood, they chose to stay in place on Chicago&#x2019;s riverfront. The decision to stay was not
      an easy one. However, the owners felt the positives of the location, which supported their mission to integrate
      holistic medicine with traditional Western medicine, outweighed negatives such as the increased insurance premiums
      that resulted (Grossmann, 2011b).</p>

    </div>


    <p class="tx">Analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats has been used as a tool to assist
      strategic planning since the 1960s. It remains effective in helping organizations choose marketing objectives that
      take into account both the organizations&#x2019; capabilities and external market opportunities, because it
      promotes proactive planning and decision making.</p>

    <p class="tx">A SWOT analysis should always be performed when a company first creates a strategic plan. After that,
      a SWOT review should be conducted at least annually&#x2014;and more frequently if changes in the marketing
      environment or internal organization warrant it. The focus of the review can be company-wide or specific to an SBU
      or a specific decision, such as whether to pursue an acquisition or merger.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consultants Sarah Simoneaux and Chris Stroud (2011) characterize the SWOT analysis as &#x201C;looking
      in the mirror&#x201D; and &#x201C;looking out the door&#x201D; (p. 76). The mirror represents the firm&#x2019;s
      internal attributes, judged to be either strengths or weaknesses. The door represents external attributes in the
      environment, which may present opportunities or threats (Simoneaux &amp; Stroud, 2011). </p>

    <p class="tx">Key factors suggested by Simoneaux and Stroud to consider in the SWOT analysis include (but are not
      limited to) the following areas:</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">corporate culture (including vision, mission, and values)</li>
      <li class="bl">current positioning strategies</li>
      <li class="bl">customer or client base</li>
      <li class="bl">customer service</li>
      <li class="bl">distribution channel/supply chain partners</li>
      <li class="bl">financial performance</li>
      <li class="bl">innovation</li>
      <li class="bl">management team</li>
      <li class="bl">product/service quality</li>
      <li class="bl">sales force</li>
      <li class="bl">staff requirements</li>
      <li class="bl">utilization of technology</li>
    </ul>

    <a id="p47"></a>
    <p class="tx">The process of conducting a SWOT analysis begins with reviewing the touchstones of corporate vision,
      mission, and values. A typical SWOT process will include a facilitator and planning group drawn from different
      business departments and job functions. The team members will meet in an environment that allows them to think
      creatively and brainstorm about strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. In highly competitive
      situations, planners repeat the process, focusing on major competitors. This can lead to important insights that
      help planners envision a number of potential scenarios.</p>

    <p class="tx">Some marketing leaders consider the SWOT analysis somewhat simplistic. If used without sufficient
      environmental analysis, it can lead to a misrepresentation of a company and its situation (Koch, 2000). The chief
      objection to the SWOT analysis is that it conflates two important and distinct
      approaches&#x2014;<strong>competitor analysis</strong> and <strong>trend analysis</strong>. Strengths and
      weaknesses are relative to competitors in the marketplace, while threats and opportunities reflect trends and
      patterns in the external environment. To combine the two invites fuzzy thinking (D. Van Mell, personal
      communication, January 19, 2018).</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.2.3">Other Analytic Approaches</h2>
    <p class="tx">Marketing practitioners use a number of tools to frame their situation analysis, and diverse terms or
      names are used for these approaches. You may find reference to environmental scanning, competitive intelligence,
      market position analysis, and more. All are used with the same intent&#x2014;to understand what is going on, in
      order to determine what to do.</p>

    <p class="tx">To summarize, the goal of a situation analysis (regardless of which analytic tools are used) is to
      match a firm&#x2019;s capabilities to market opportunities. When a situation analysis reveals something customers
      value, something a company can do better than any competitor, marketing planners have struck gold. The following
      example shows how the business known today as Patio Foods was born from a situation analysis that struck (frozen)
      gold in a challenging external environment in the late 1950s.</p>


    <div class="photo-left">

      <p class="photo-caption">The Stumberg family business&#x2019;s internal analysis revealed a declining customer
        base but an asset in their infrastructure and distribution systems. The company became a leading purveyor of
        Tex-Mex TV dinners.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.2.4">Situation Analysis Example: Patio Foods</h2>
    <p class="tx">When the Stumberg family in San Antonio, Texas, turned to selling frozen Mexican food, it was an act
      of desperation.</p>

    <p class="tx">Henry Stumberg started a frozen vegetable business in 1946 with his sons Ed and Louis in San Antonio,
      but prices for frozen vegetables plummeted when other companies entered the national market. Competition knocked
      the bottom out of the Stumberg family business, which sold to supermarkets throughout Texas. Ed Stumberg observed
      that the five military bases in San Antonio were creating new fans for Tex-Mex cuisine. He reasoned that they
      might want to continue eating Tex-Mex when they returned home. The Stumbergs began shipping frozen tamales and
      chili across the state. In the late 1950s they formed Patio Foods and went on to distribute Tex-Mex food as TV
      dinners nationwide.</p>

    <a id="p48"></a>
    <p class="tx">We can only guess what went on around the Stumberg family&#x2019;s conference room or dinner table as
      the family business made its shift from frozen vegetables to TV dinners. While they may not have explicitly
      applied the tools described here, it&#x2019;s likely the idea emerged from what we would recognize as a situation
      analysis. Their environmental analysis, beginning with internal analysis, would reveal a declining customer base
      as price competition ate into frozen vegetable sales but an existing asset in infrastructure (freezers) and
      distribution systems. External analysis of the micro environment would reveal enthusiasm for Tex-Mex food among
      military personnel on the local bases. Analysis of the macro environment would reveal the growing popularity of
      the new frozen product called a TV dinner (introduced by C. A. Swanson &amp; Sons in 1953). Their SWOT analysis
      would bring to light how their internal strengths and weaknesses fit with external opportunities and
      threats&#x2014;that their supply and distribution capacities and expertise in Tex-Mex products was an excellent
      fit to the growing market of Tex-Mex enthusiasts. </p>

    <p class="tx">The marketing opportunity the Stumbergs discovered in the face of competition for frozen vegetable
      sales carried them to financial triumph. Patio Foods was acquired by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1967 as
      part of its effort to diversify its product line in the face of antismoking sentiment (Mufson, 1999) Louis
      Stumberg was named vice chair of RJR Foods Inc., the tobacco company&#x2019;s food and beverage subsidiary.
      Subsequent acquisitions took the brand to Del Monte, ConAgra Foods, and most recently J&amp;J Snack Brands
      (Hendricks, 2011). </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.2.5">Situation Analysis Requires Research</h2>
    <p class="tx">Situation analysis is where the process that leads to customer loyalty and referrals begins. But
      planning should never take place in a vacuum. The situation analysis will require more information before it can
      be considered complete. Market research will fill in the unknowns that have come to light as marketers look for
      opportunities to support the company&#x2019;s strategic goals.</p>

    <p class="tx">Internal analysis rarely requires research, as it is usually a straightforward process. Unless the
      company is a recent acquisition, its planners will have a strong sense of its history, current situation, and
      future direction. If research is needed for the internal analysis, it will be to quantify certain factors like
      market share or to gain insights into current customers through analysis of sales records, results of past
      marketing campaigns, and so on.</p>

    <p class="tx">External analysis tends to be more complex and is likely to raise more questions. Research will be
      needed to find out about competitors, potential target markets, industry and consumer trends, and more. At this
      point, marketing planners put the situation analysis on hold while they conduct the research needed to fill in
      these blanks. Chapter 8 explores external analysis in depth as part of its examination of the marketing
      environment.</p>

    <p class="tx">Once research has produced the needed information, marketing planners circle back to this step in the
      marketing process to finish their situation analysis. When complete, it is a document that summarizes
      opportunities to satisfy customer needs. It will also summarize problems that must be resolved in order to take
      advantage of those opportunities. </p>

    <a id="p49"></a>
    <p class="tx">Plans are most effective when documented in writing. A company&#x2019;s strategic plan will typically
      exist as a written document disseminated to managers throughout the organization. The marketing department will
      produce a marketing plan document, which will include the situation analysis as a rationale for the strategies
      selected for execution. The document describes in detail what will take place and why&#x2014;and how effectiveness
      will be measured&#x2014;for each campaign. Chapter 9 includes a more detailed discussion of these documents used
      by marketing managers.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Imagine yourself in a situation like the Stumbergs of Patio Foods. You&#x2019;ve got freezers and a
        distribution system and too much competition for the frozen vegetable business you once pursued profitably.
        Let&#x2019;s say you were growing fruit, not vegetables, and located in Seattle, Washington, instead of San
        Antonio, Texas. Apply internal and external analysis to your current situation. Can you find a new market
        opportunity?</p>
    </div>


    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec2.3">2.3&#x2002;Marketing Process Step 2: Marketing Strategy</h1>


    <p class="tx">This second step in the marketing process has the goal of choosing an approach to take advantage of
      what has been learned about the situation. What objective should marketing try to achieve? But it would be
      premature to make a hypothesis about what to do before gathering more information. Therefore, marketers begin this
      step by conducting research. Their task is to provide the specific market information necessary to develop a
      <strong>marketing strategy</strong>&#x2014;a plan to target a market segment and design a marketing mix that will
      profitably deliver value to those customers. The foremost reason to conduct market research is to gain a deep
      understanding of customer needs by identifying segments worthy of targeting and finding value propositions that
      will resonate with them&#x2014;in other words, to support the three components of the STP approach.</p>

    <p class="tx">Every company needs a deep understanding of its specific situation regarding the CVE. Without that
      knowledge, a company cannot fully take advantage of the opportunity presented by unmet customer needs. The outcome
      of this step will be a <strong>value proposition</strong>&#x2014;a statement that targets potential customers and
      describes why they should buy a specific offering from a specific company (as discussed in Chapter 1). The concept
      of the value proposition is credited to Rosser Reeves, chair of the Ted Bates &amp; Co. advertising agency in the
      1950s, who dubbed it the <strong>unique selling proposition (USP)</strong> (Daye, 2010).</p>



    <p class="tx">Reeves was one of the first to develop a technique for communicating in an overcrowded marketplace.
      His definition of what makes a USP or value proposition holds true today. According to Reeves, a value proposition
      has three component parts. First, it must make a proposition to the potential customer: &#x201C;Buy this, and you
      will receive a specified benefit.&#x201D; Second, that proposition must be something no competitor can claim or
      that competitors have not chosen to emphasize in their promotions. Finally, the proposition must be so compelling
      that it motivates individuals to act.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider how the Mars candy company slogan for M&amp;M&#x2019;s delivers the three required
      components.</p>

    <a id="p50"></a>
    <div class="photo-right">
      <img id="img2.3" class="scaled" alt="Bowl of M&amp;M&#x2019;s chocolate candies."
        title="Bowl of M&amp;M&#x2019;s chocolate candies." src="images/2.3.jpg">
      <p class="credit">DebbiSmirnoff / iStock / Getty</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">The M&amp;M&#x2019;s slogan promises a specific benefit that no competing candy claims.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="ext">&#x201C;M&amp;M&#x2019;s melt in your mouth, not in your hand.&#x201D;</p>

    <p class="tx">The slogan promises a specific benefit that no competing candy claims and that will compel people wary
      of messy chocolate to action.</p>

    <p class="tx">A concept closely related to the value proposition is positioning&#x2014;marketers&#x2019; practice of
      creating an image or identity in the minds of prospective customers that allows one offering to stand out among
      many. The identity created through positioning reflects the reasoning behind the value proposition and the promise
      made by the USP. This suite of concepts is explored in more depth in Chapter 6.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.3.1">Reasons for Market Research</h2>
    <p class="tx">Recall from Chapter 1 that market research is defined as the collection and analysis of data to
      produce information for decision making. The market research conducted in step 2 of the marketing process produces
      the information needed to find a value proposition&#x2014;the unique and compelling promise of customer benefits
      on which marketing strategy can be based. Marketers do research to become better informed about customers&#x2019;
      needs and desires, about emerging market opportunities, and about changes in customers&#x2019; attitudes and
      purchase patterns. This information increases marketers&#x2019; ability to make informed strategic decisions.
      Later in the marketing process, market research is conducted to refine campaigns being developed and to measure
      results after the marketing strategy&#x2019;s execution.</p>

    <p class="tx">Current practice in market research is being driven by a need for businesses to be more
      agile&#x2014;to be able to respond to conditions with a pivot to a new strategy with speed. This moves the
      emphasis to <strong>primary research</strong> (conducted by market researchers directly) as opposed to
      <strong>secondary research</strong> (information found in existing published sources). The macro environment is
      moving at such a pace that by the time published sources become available, the information may have become
      obsolete.</p>

    <p class="tx">Another way to categorize types of research is by their purpose. <strong>Exploratory research</strong>
      generates insights about a situation. It helps marketers determine the nature of a problem, define issues, and
      suggest hypotheses. It can often lead to new lines of inquiry and further research. It is not typically used for
      decision making but rather to gather preliminary information. Exploratory research may also delve deeper into
      trends coming to light in the situation analysis. A typical example of exploratory research might be an inquiry
      into whether an innovative product idea can be profitably developed. </p>

    <a id="p51"></a>
    <p class="tx">Following exploratory research comes <strong>conclusive research</strong>, which serves the purpose of
      verifying the insights generated from exploratory research. Conclusive research typically involves a more
      systematic, structured method of data collection and analysis. Conclusive research needs to result in
      statistically and scientifically valid results that can support predictions (the hypotheses generated from
      exploratory research). The purpose of conclusive research is to help marketers determine which of several proposed
      strategies is most likely to succeed (Pride &amp; Ferrell, 2017). </p>

    <p class="tx">In the marketing strategy phase we are discussing, marketing research typically focuses on the
      following aspects:</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">consumer behavior, to select market segments to target</li>
      <li class="bl">innovation, to discover a target market&#x2019;s unmet or poorly met needs and then find ideas for
        products or services to fill those needs or fill them better</li>
      <li class="bl">competitors&#x2019; strategies, to find a value proposition based on a benefit that competitors
        cannot or have not chosen to claim</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Later in the marketing process, in the campaign development and measurement steps, research will have
      different objectives.</p>

    <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s look closer at research into consumer behavior, perhaps the most essential of the areas
      listed above, since without a target market a company will likely try to be &#x201C;all things to all
      people&#x201D; and thus fail to develop a compelling value proposition.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.3.2">Research to Understand Consumer Behavior</h2>
    <p class="tx">Have you ever responded to a telephone survey? Returned a questionnaire received in the mail? Been
      asked to take a short survey when you leave a website? If so, you&#x2019;ve been on the receiving end of market
      research. What were marketers&#x2019; reasons for conducting the research? Most likely, they were looking to
      understand your behavior&#x2014;not you, specifically, but the market segment of which you represent one sample
      individual.</p>

    <p class="tx">Research that helps marketers understand consumer behavior will lead to identification of distinct
      market segments. Among those segments, research will reveal which are likely to offer profitable customers. Thus
      begins the fundamental marketing task of segmentation and targeting.</p>

    <p class="tx">Back in the production and sales eras, marketers were product-centric. They made few distinctions
      among types of consumers. That strategy was later replaced with consumer-centric strategies in the marketing era,
      in which targeting systems emerged, primarily based on demographic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics. As
      the relationship era brought appreciation for customer lifetime value, companies sought even more information from
      consumers, blending in purchase history and shopping behavior. Reflecting this progression, the execution of
      marketing campaigns has evolved from mass-market advertising through targeted campaigns toward one-to-one
      messaging driven by customer data. To achieve the level of consumer insight necessary for targeting, segmentation,
      and one-to-one messaging, marketers need to collect data&#x2014;hence the demand for market research.</p>

    <a id="p52"></a>
    <p class="tx">The types of data collected can be <em>quantitative</em> or <em>qualitative</em>. <strong>Quantitative
        research</strong> methods produce numeric data using structured questions. It is useful when there is no
      ambiguity about the concepts being measured. Exploratory research is more likely to be designed to collect
      qualitative data, typically from a relatively small sample. Examples of quantitative data gathering include</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">surveys (measuring the opinions or experiences of a group of people via a set of questions);</li>
      <li class="bl">sampling (getting opinions from people representative of a specific group); and</li>
      <li class="bl">data reports (detailing the data collected, how it was analyzed, and the conclusions drawn from the
        data).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Firms used to draw heavily on the secondary research approach, drawing on resources like the Consumer
      Expenditure Survey conducted annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Consumer Expenditure Survey
      represents research gathered by <em>primary</em> quantitative methods. When marketers draw on data from this
      survey in their research, they are conducting <em>secondary</em> quantitative research&#x2014;because they did not
      directly collect the data they are using. However, the lag time between data collection and dissemination is
      causing marketers, who need up-to-the-minute data to drive their hypotheses and decisions, to turn more frequently
      to primary research methods and qualitative data collection techniques.</p>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Qualitative research</strong> methods are helpful in hazier situations, in which it would be
      difficult to develop structured questions. Qualitative research methods bring to light perceptions and feelings
      and help reveal problems and opportunities. Conclusive research is more likely to rely on quantitative data,
      gathered from a larger sample population. Examples of qualitative data gathering include</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">customer advisory boards,</li>
      <li class="bl">focus groups,</li>
      <li class="bl">interviews,</li>
      <li class="bl">mall intercepts, </li>
      <li class="bl">social listening, and</li>
      <li class="bl">ethnography.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Customer advisory boards</strong> are groups of existing customers, convened at regular
      intervals to advise management on trends and priorities from their perspective. These advisory boards or councils
      provide opportunities for cocreation and engagement.</p>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Focus groups</strong> involve selecting a small number of people (typically 6 to 12)
      representative of the consumer segment being studied, and then guiding a discussion to discover what they think or
      feel about a particular subject. </p>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Interviews</strong> involve a one-to-one conservation to gather information. <strong>Mall
        intercepts</strong> are short interviews conducted by randomly stopping and asking questions of shoppers in a
      mall. </p>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Social listening</strong> consists of monitoring online conversations to understand what
      customers are saying about a brand or industry.</p>

    <a id="p53"></a>
    <p class="tx"><strong>Ethnography</strong> is a type of qualitative research involving a detailed study of a group
      to describe its behavior, characteristics, cultural mores, and the like. Retail ethnography is a particularly
      interesting type of qualitative research that applies ethnography&#x2019;s techniques to consumer behavior, such
      as shopping choices.</p>

    <p class="tx">An increasingly useful type of quantitative research is <strong>netnography</strong> (a term derived
      from <em>Internet</em> and <em>ethnography</em>). Netnography is a branch of ethnography that analyzes the
      self-directed behavior of individuals on the Internet to provide useful insights. After Starbucks introduced its
      VIA Ready Brew powdered coffee beans in single-serve packets, netnography helped the company&#x2019;s marketers
      confirm that customers weren&#x2019;t reacting negatively to the fact that the iconic brand was now selling
      &#x201C;instant coffee.&#x201D; Comments in online communities trended positive (Nguyen, 2012).</p>

    <p class="tx">The examples in Table 2.4 suggest how these different types of research produce different types of
      information. </p>

    <p class="tx">Lab42, a market research survey platform provider, used primary, quantitative research to help an
      independent consultant answer three questions concerning consumer behavior:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"> At what age did women start using makeup, and who taught them how to apply it?</li>
      <li class="nl"> How did women choose their preferred brands of makeup?</li>
      <li class="nl"> How often did women purchase makeup?</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">Lab42 fielded an online survey to women aged 18&#x2013;30. The firm deployed the survey across a
      variety of social networks. It added ambiguous qualifying questions to the beginning of the survey to ensure it
      was reaching out only to women of the target age group. Lab42 was able to help the client slice the data into
      various market segments and understand how the data answered the three research questions, thus determining the
      target markets for a niche makeup brand with the most profit potential. </p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.3.3">Conducting Market Research</h2>
    <p class="tx">Now that we&#x2019;ve explored why this second step of the marketing process requires research and
      what types of research can be conducted, we turn to the question &#x201C;How is market research conducted?&#x201D;
      There are five steps in the process:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"> Problem definition: Statement of the purpose for research, usually a question tied to one of the
        reasons for research identified earlier in this chapter.</li>
      <li class="nl"> Research design: Selection of a research method (primary or secondary) and data type (quantitative
        or qualitative) for the research project.</li>
      <li class="nl"> Data collection: Implementation of the research project as defined and designed in previous steps.
        This may involve conducting fieldwork to collect primary data or gathering information from secondary data
        sources.</li>
      <li class="nl"> Data analysis: Use of descriptive statistics of quantitative data and/or summaries of qualitative
        data to turn information into insight.</li>
      <li class="nl"> Report presentation: The writing up of findings to express insights or new knowledge gained, for
        presentation to management and other stakeholders.</li>
    </ol>


    <div class="figure-box-right-thin">
      <h4 class="figure-name">Figure 2.5: Market research process</h4>
      <h5 class="figure-title">Five steps make up the market research process.</h5>

        title="Diagram of the process for market research." class="figure" id="fig_2.5">

    </div>

    <p class="tx">Figure 2.5 highlights these steps.</p>

    <p class="tx">A complex problem may require several types of research, such as a focus group to generate ideas for a
      value proposition, followed by a questionnaire to test the appeal of several versions of the value proposition. In
      that case step 2 would describe each research initiative; steps 3 and 4 would include separate steps of data
      collection and analysis for each initiative. Step 5 would bring the results of all initiatives together in a final
      presentation.</p>

    <p class="tx">To review the marketing process so far:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"> Situation analysis: Identify opportunities to fill unmet customer needs.</li>
      <li class="nl"> Marketing strategy: Design and conduct research; develop segmentation, targeting, and positioning
        strategies.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">Once marketers have conducted research, they fold the results into their strategic planning. One
      hypothesis about &#x201C;what to do&#x201D; to achieve the goals described in the company&#x2019;s strategic plan
      will be chosen to drive this iteration of the marketing process. That hypothesis becomes the marketing strategy.
      With the first and second steps of the marketing process complete, marketers can move on to the campaign
      development phase.</p>

    <a id="p55"></a>
    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Returning to the Patio Foods example discussed earlier in this chapter, consider how creators of the
        TV dinner might have used market research to identify a target market, discover new product ideas, find a
        compelling value proposition, or detect market trends. Choose one of these research purposes and describe a
        research project for a frozen meal business.</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec2.4">2.4&#x2002;Marketing Process Step 3: Campaign Development</h1>

    <p class="tx">In this step, marketers make decisions covering components of the marketing mix&#x2014;product
      development, pricing, place (including both location and distribution issues), and promotions. Their goal is to
      develop a campaign plan in response to the opportunity identified in the first step, situation analysis, that
      creatively communicates to the target market the value proposition identified in the second step, marketing
      strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Campaign development</strong> demands a marketing mix based on what a company is selling to a
      target market and how the company plans to reach it. Each campaign strategy will specify a <strong>message
        channel</strong> and a value proposition chosen to reach a specific target market and a <strong>call to
        action</strong> that will move individuals in that niche to take a specific next step&#x2014;engage, purchase,
      recommend, join, and so on.</p>

    <p class="tx">The message channel is the medium, such as a radio station, website, or mailing list, used by
      marketers to deliver a message to a target audience. Message channels are categorized by the type of audience they
      reach, which may be mass market, targeted, or individual (one-to-one). The choice of message channel is driven by
      the strategies of the marketing mix, most directly by strategic decisions in the promotions quadrant.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.4.1">The Shift From Mass-Market Toward One-to-One Campaigns</h2>
    <p class="tx">Any discussion of campaign development today must acknowledge the tremendous increase in computing
      power that has made <strong>one-to-one marketing</strong> possible. The arrival of technology capable of managing
      vast databases has created an opportunity for marketers to shift from campaigns driven by use of mass-market
      message channels to much more effective and cost-efficient processes that reach individuals one by one.</p>

    <p class="tx">A compelling reason companies rely on targeted marketing strategies is to focus spending on those most
      likely to buy. Today many companies employ one-to-one marketing&#x2014;a highly sophisticated method of tailoring
      messages and delivering them to individuals.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers must choose message channels that reach the target market they&#x2019;ve selected. They must
      also make sure the campaign they&#x2019;re developing adheres to other parameters laid out for the campaign in the
      marketing strategy, such as budget and time period needed to accomplish each goal.</p>

    <a id="p56"></a>
    <p class="tx">Mass-market campaigns push an advertising message to an audience through mass media, using message
      channels such as television, radio, social media, or newspapers. Targeted campaigns use tailored channels to reach
      specific market segments, such as people in a specific geographic area (for example, readers of <em>Chicago</em>
      magazine) or those who share an interest (e.g., listeners to an all-gospel radio station). One-to-one campaigns
      push an advertising message to an individual using a one-to-one message channel, typically direct mail or e-mail.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have become tools for one-to-one marketing, as well,
      blending aspects of market research, lead generation, and customer service. Banks of digital marketers engage in
      social listening, observing customers&#x2019; mentions of their brand or industry in social media and drawing
      insights from that aggregated data. Salespeople mine online profiles for details they can use in rapport-building
      with prospects, such as photographs showing vacations or hobbies. Online customer care staff monitor social
      streams for complaints, then reach out to individuals to resolve the issue. Each can be seen as a one-to-one
      message channel, because communication originates with a single online message.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers selling products and services that are needed by just about everybody have little need to
      move toward one-to-one campaign techniques. If the appeal of a value proposition is broad enough, mass media is a
      good choice to convey the message. Because so many people eat fast food, use skin care products, and prepare their
      taxes every year, you see these offerings marketed in the mass media. When politicians run for office, they want
      every vote, and so they use mass media.</p>

    <p class="tx">On the other hand, marketers know that today&#x2019;s consumers are eager for dialogue and engagement.
      They prefer a personal approach to a &#x201C;one-size-fits-all&#x201D; campaign. Marketers have learned that using
      techniques closer to the one-to-one end of the spectrum can be more effective with certain types of offerings. Ads
      aimed at niches can appear in online as well as in traditional broadcast or print message channels. Either can be
      considered fairly targeted but not yet one-to-one, because no individual has been specified to receive the
      message.</p>

    <p class="tx">Volkswagen did a superior job of creating advertisements that match specific brands to specific target
      markets, even though using mass media as a message channel. A series of TV commercials created in 2000 showed
      Volkswagen&#x2019;s different car models matched to different life stages, depicting typical buyers moving from
      their first Golf as teenagers, through a Jetta for their carefree &#x201C;singleton&#x201D; years, and purchasing
      a Passat or Touareg minivan when the babies start coming.</p>

    <p class="tx">Catalog marketers were among the first to use customer purchase data to drive campaigns toward more
      tightly targeted niches. A woman who buys maternity clothes from a general JCPenney catalog will soon start
      receiving smaller catalogs from JCPenney displaying maternity fashions only. Before long, a baby-products catalog
      will follow.</p>

    <p class="tx">Taking targeting to the one-to-one level, direct-mail food merchandiser the Wisconsin Cheeseman began
      inserting a customized order form into every holiday catalog as soon as printing technology allowed it. The
      company mailed catalogs to past customers preprinted with each individual customer&#x2019;s order from the prior
      year, making it supremely easy to order the same products again each holiday.</p>

    <a id="p57"></a>
    <p class="tx">To deploy one-to-one campaigns, marketers must have access to a database of customer and/or product
      information. Have you ever received an invitation to schedule a health care screening right around your birthday?
      Have you received a mailer from your car dealership on the anniversary of your last purchase, suggesting you might
      like to trade up to a newer car? These are examples of data-driven one-to-one marketing campaigns, directed to you
      based on information on file about you.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.4.2">Share of Market or Share of Customer?</h2>
    <p class="tx">With mass-market campaigns, marketers hope to increase their share of the marketplace. In other words,
      if 100 people exist who might buy a thingamajig, the makers of Acme brand thingamajigs use mass-media advertising
      to get as many of those 100 people as possible to make a purchase, winning market share away from competitors.</p>

    <p class="tx">With one-to-one marketing, the focus shifts from capturing <em>share of market</em> to <em>share of
        cus</em><em></em><em>tomer</em>, gaining more of individuals&#x2019; purchases over their lifetimes. With this
      strategy, the marketers at Acme hope to get each of those 100 people in the habit of buying Acme brand
      thingamajigs repeatedly.</p>

    <p class="tx">One-to-one marketing can be a company&#x2019;s only campaign strategy or a supplement to mass-market
      campaigns. If used as a supplement&#x2014;part of a strategy to drive both share of market and share of
      customer&#x2014;the messages must be coordinated.</p>

    <p class="tx">Table 2.5 illustrates where different types of message channels fall on the spectrum from mass-market
      to one-to-one campaigns. Most marketers combine techniques to increase both market share and lifetime share of the
      customer.</p>

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. Message channels occupy a place on a spectrum from mass-market to
      one-to-one approaches, with targeted message channels in between.</p>

    <a id="p58"></a>
    <p class="tx">The ability to conduct one-to-one campaigns raises ethical issues. The promise of one-to-one marketing
      is that consumers benefit from it; more of the messages they receive are tailored more closely to their needs and
      interests. But consumers can perceive one-to-one marketing as intrusive, especially as concerns mount about the
      security of personal information. The responsibility lies with marketers to ask permission for the data they
      collect and not to exploit customer data beyond reasonable boundaries. We&#x2019;ll return to this subject in
      Chapter&#xA0;10.</p>

    <p class="tx">Other elements of the campaign development step include creation of a media plan and an evaluation
      plan. The <em>media plan</em> specifies what message channels will be used and on what schedule. Today&#x2019;s
      media plans usually combine mass media, targeted media, and one-to-one messaging, including social media as well
      as traditional channels. The <em>evaluation plan</em> addresses how the effectiveness of marketing messages will
      be measured. These plans will be defined and explained in Chapter 9&#x2019;s discussion of the media planning
      function.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.4.3">Another Round of Research for Campaign Development</h2>
    <p class="tx">The campaign development stage of the marketing process is almost complete once the decisions about
      marketing mix, message channel strategy, media plan, and evaluation plan have been made. There&#x2019;s just one
      more task for marketers before moving on to execution: research to make sure the decisions made so far are sound.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Depending on a company&#x2019;s management structure and relationships, it may need to secure final
      approval of a campaign before executing it. An ad agency will need to get its client company&#x2019;s approval; a
      marketing department may need approval of the firm&#x2019;s chief executive officer (CEO) or chief marketing
      officer (CMO). Research with the target audience that provides evidence of sound strategy is very helpful in
      gaining approval when presenting concepts to decision makers inside the company or ad agency.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider the following example: A Wisconsin advertising agency was asked to develop an antismoking
      campaign targeted at middle-school-aged (sixth- to eighth-grade) youths (Olderman, 2011). The advertising agency
      strategists viewed videos from national antismoking campaigns, analyzing which appeals were used. Following this
      preliminary work, the agency developed three campaign concepts.</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"> Smoking is bad for your health.</li>
      <li class="nl"> Smoking makes you less attractive.</li>
      <li class="nl"> Big tobacco companies are trying to manipulate you into smoking.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">To which proposition would young people respond most strongly? To find out, the agency conducted focus
      groups around the state. The pitch highlighting health negatives did not move the youths at all. They responded
      more strongly to the caution about reduced attractiveness, but not by much. The proposition that really got their
      attention was the affront to their independence and autonomy they sensed in the third concept.
      &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t let Big Tobacco manipulate you&#x201D; became the theme of the ad campaign against teen
      smoking (Wisconsin Department of Health Services, 2018). This example shows how market research produced insights
      into which campaign message should be selected for execution. We&#x2019;ll return to this example in the context
      of the final step of the marketing process, measurement.</p>

    <a id="p59"></a>
    <p class="tx">During the campaign development stage of the marketing process, marketers apply the four Ps of the
      marketing mix; they select a strategy that describes how the campaign will use mass-market, targeted, and
      one-to-one message channels; and finally, the marketers develop a campaign message based on an underlying value
      proposition. After testing the message to be sure it will work, the next step is execution&#x2014;rolling out the
      campaign. At this point, the marketing strategy can be documented in a written marketing plan, to control the
      actions that follow.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s return to the frozen dinner business niche. Select a food item or category like Tex-Mex
        or low fat for your entree. Describe your business using the four Ps of the marketing mix.</p>

      <p class="tx">What blend of mass-market, targeted, or one-to-one message channels do you think will be most
        effective in reaching customers?</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec2.5">2.5&#x2002;Marketing Process Step 4: Execution</h1>

    <p class="tx">In this step, marketers implement the campaign they&#x2019;ve developed, and then monitor its
      execution and adjust the campaign if needed. The marketing strategy identified in the second step of the marketing
      process comes to life. </p>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Execution</strong> of a mass-market campaign involves buying media and filling it with
      persuasive content or creating a social media environment that reaches a community of interest in less traditional
      ways. The media plan (created during campaign development) specifies which message channels will be used,
      including any or all on the spectrum from mass media to one-to-one, including print, broadcast, or social media.
      Media planning is a specialized function within an ad agency or marketing department.</p>

    <p class="tx">Once the media plan is in place, content must be created to fill it. Every piece of the plan, from the
      briefest radio spot to the most elaborate video production, requires creative execution. Execution puts the

          of the 1960s</em></h1>
      <p class="tx">During the 1960s the promotions component of the marketing mix drove a creative revolution in which
        campaigns featured candor, humor, and irony as a way to reject marketing practices that were increasingly
        criticized for promoting materialism and deceiving consumers. Follow this link to read about one of the real

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.5.1">Data Drives One-to-One Campaigns </h2>
    <p class="tx">With the shift to one-to-one marketing, execution demands not just one advertising message but an
      entire system of elements driven by fields in a database. A specialized printing technique called <strong>variable
        data printing</strong> makes it possible to print and deliver mail pieces that are customized right down to the
      individual recipient. Without this technique, the Wisconsin Cheeseman could not have inserted a personalized order
      form into each customer&#x2019;s catalog. E-mail and websites can be personalized with variable data in the same
      way printed pieces can.</p>

    <p class="tx">Fields in a database drive more than just names&#x2014;each element of a printed or online
      communication piece, including the images, benefit statements, and offers, can change based on data about the
      recipient. It&#x2019;s common for marketers to use images that mirror each recipient&#x2019;s age, gender, and
      ethnicity. The data that drives one-to-one campaigns comes from a sophisticated <strong>data warehouse</strong>
      containing information from sales, marketing, and customer service activities. Without the data warehouse, there
      would be no data fields to drive the variable messages and nowhere for data about the outcome to accumulate.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.5.2">Monitoring the Campaign</h2>
    <p class="tx">Once the media planners and creative department have finished their work and the campaign launches, is
      execution complete? No; marketers must monitor all the media channels used to be sure each component is executed
      as planned.</p>

    <p class="tx">Radio and TV messages can be bumped by breaking news. Playback of the messages can be garbled due to
      technical glitches. Mail pieces can be misdelivered. E-mail can be trapped in spam filters. Online campaigns can
      go off track when servers go down, which can result when a successful promotion generates more response than
      expected. For example, when Marvel Entertainment announced at SXSW in 2013 that it would offer seven hundred No. 1
      issues of popular comic books free for digital download for the next 2 days, its technology partner, comiXology,
      was unprepared. Within a day its servers had crashed. The freebies had to be halted temporarily. ComiXology
      rewrote its code for delivering the free download, inserting a registration step that allowed it to moderate the
      flow of interest enough to allow its servers to keep up (Cheredar, 2013).</p>

    <a id="p61"></a>
    <p class="tx">Marketers must ensure that make-goods (refunds for ads that do not run as scheduled) are issued if
      another company is at fault, such as a particular television station or e-mail distribution service. If the
      company is at fault, execution plans must be adjusted to remedy the error and get the campaign back on track.</p>

    <p class="tx">Another form of monitoring also takes place during the execution step: monitoring the creative work on
      the campaign as it is developed, to be sure it stays aligned with the strategic plan. Creative people tend to want
      to push limits. Someone on the team must counter that tendency by monitoring that each decision regarding the four
      Ps of the marketing mix is reflected in the creative execution. In an ad agency, this might fall to someone with
      the title of traffic manager or account manager. In a corporate marketing department, the title might be marketing
      manager or marketing director. If monitoring the campaign reveals problems, then adjustments must be made to get
      the campaign back into alignment with the strategic plan.</p>

    <p class="tx">In summary, the fourth step in the marketing process, execution, involves the tasks of specifying
      which message channels will be used (described in a media plan), creating content to fill the message channels,
      and monitoring that the messages stay aligned with strategy and get delivered according to plan. When one-to-one
      messaging is called for, data must be available to drive it&#x2014;therefore, execution also involves data
      management.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Careers in marketing mentioned in relation to the execution step include media planning and creating
        content for advertising and other marketing communications, as well as traffic and account managers. Earlier
        steps involved the work of strategic planners and researchers&#x2014;other careers in marketing. Does one or
        more of these career opportunities interest you? Why?</p>

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec2.6">2.6&#x2002;Marketing Process Step 5: Measurement</h1>

    <p class="tx">In the marketing process, there would be no sales without execution of marketing campaigns. And
      without sales, there&#x2019;s no opportunity to please customers. To discover whether campaigns are effective in
      not just attracting customers but also making sales, there&#x2019;s only one thing to do: measure them. In the
      <strong>measurement</strong> step of the marketing process, marketers use research to measure the impact of the
      marketing strategy that has made its way through campaign development and execution.</p>

    <p class="tx">Two fundamental information needs make measurement imperative. The more obvious need is for inputs to
      future strategy decisions, which will allow for improvement with each campaign cycle based on what worked best in
      previous cycles. Less obvious but just as important is the need to demonstrate the marketing department&#x2019;s
      contribution to the success of the organization.</p>

    <p class="tx">But can marketing&#x2019;s impact be measured? If so, with what precision?</p>

    <a id="p62"></a>
    <p class="tx">The standard measure of organizational success used by financial managers is the calculation of
      <strong>return on investment (ROI)</strong>. This measure is a ratio that compares the money gained or lost on an
      investment relative to the amount of money invested. In the marketing process, the goal of step 5 is to measure
      the money generated in sales (or other desired gain, such as an increase in brand awareness or ability to recall a
      product&#x2019;s benefits) relative to the amount of money invested in the campaign. Marketers have begun calling
      this measure <strong>return on marketing investment (ROMI)</strong>.</p>

    <p class="tx">Ideally, every marketing strategy is measured, with information about its outcome feeding each
      subsequent round of strategic planning. Sadly, marketing measurement is often neglected. Measurement can be
      expensive. Some companies simply won&#x2019;t include a budget to pay for it in their marketing plans. Ad agencies
      tend not to emphasize measurement&#x2014;it might shift budget dollars away from media buys or creative
      tasks&#x2014;or worse, reveal that a campaign they created was not effective. And, compared to the work of
      developing strategies and creating advertising, measurement is simply not very exciting. When measurement takes
      place in today&#x2019;s business landscape, it is driven by the need to prove that what is paid for is performing
      up to expectations. The need to show ROMI drives measurement.</p>

    <p class="tx">Government units typically require measurement of the marketing processes they engage in, because they
      must justify their budgets to comply with rigorous fiscal management and legislative oversight. The antismoking
      campaign example mentioned earlier included measures of effectiveness. Evaluation was planned into every aspect of
      the campaign&#x2019;s 3-year-long execution. The campaign, which encompassed advertising targeted to different
      populations, a teaching curriculum, and participatory youth events, was measured by monitoring the change in the
      number of new smokers among members of the target populations, based on the state&#x2019;s ongoing program to
      measure tobacco use. Execution and measurement were coordinated by the ad agency and paid for by the state of
      Wisconsin. In this case the outcome was positive: a decrease in new smokers each year of the program (Wisconsin
      Department of Health Services, 2018).</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.6.1">Plan Ahead for Measurement</h2>
    <p class="tx">How a campaign is executed can build in means for measurement. One-to-one campaigns have the advantage
      of being highly measurable, unlike mass-market campaigns. The ease of quantifying campaign response is one reason
      marketers are using more one-to-one marketing. The data warehouse records the campaign information that went to
      the customer and captures the customer&#x2019;s subsequent behavior. If a variable-data-printed birthday
      health-screening reminder is followed by an appointment for a health screening, marketers can justifiably claim
      that their campaign caused that result. Measuring targeted or mass-media campaigns is more difficult, but it can
      be done if marketers plan ahead, although not with the same degree of specificity as one-to-one campaigns.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing measurement tracks the behavior of groups of people over time. It requires comparison of a
      &#x201C;before&#x201D; state to an &#x201C;after&#x201D; state. Effective measurement also requires a test group
      and a control group&#x2014;a population that receives the campaign message and a similar population unaware of the
      message. These pairs can be pulled from similar geographic areas or similar market segments, depending on the
      campaign strategy. Planning for measurement should include specifications for the time frame and the groups that
      will be measured for comparison.</p>

    <a id="p63"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec2.6.2">What to Measure?</h2>
    <p class="tx">If the overall goal of this step is to measure the impact of a marketing strategy, what data points
      might provide insight into that impact?</p>

    <p class="tx">To calculate ROI or ROMI, the key data are monetary amounts generated in sales relative to the
      monetary amount expended to conduct the marketing campaign. When the goal is something other than sales, such as
      an increase in brand awareness, measuring ROI/ROMI is much more difficult, as the monetary value of that
      intangible increase must be estimated.</p>

    <p class="tx">Measuring campaign effectiveness is one means of assessing the impact of a marketing strategy. It,
      too, can be considered market research, although for very different purposes than research to select a strategy or
      provide evidence the strategy is sound.</p>

    <p class="tx">Some data <em>directly</em> reflect measures of campaign effectiveness; other data <em>indirectly</em>
      reflect campaign effectiveness by looking to operational performance for evidence.</p>

    <p class="tx">A direct measure of campaign effectiveness is the <strong>A/B split</strong>, a technique in which
      elements of a message are varied and tested one by one. The elements may be as subtle as two different headlines
      or as dramatic as two completely different value propositions. The message being tested can be a print ad, a web
      page, a social media post, an e-mail message&#x2014;the technique works regardless of the form the message takes.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">The A/B split technique was used by a health care device manufacturer to test two pitches for a
      medical ventilator (a device to help patients breathe). One message promised a nurse&#x2019;s advocate would be
      available around the clock to answer questions on the ventilator&#x2019;s use. The other message omitted any
      mention of the nurse&#x2019;s advocate but otherwise conveyed the same value proposition. The ad promising the
      nurse&#x2019;s advocate pulled much better response in preliminary tests, convincing the company that the cost of
      adding a nurse to the staff would be recouped in sales (Olderman, 2011).</p>

      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 2.6: </strong><em>Which Ad Pulled Best?</em></h1>

    </div>

    <a id="p64"></a>
    <p class="tx">The A/B split advertising measurement method has been in use for decades and continues to be a
      reliable method for improving campaign response. <em>Field Trip 2.5</em> gives an example from Gallup &amp;
      Robinson, an advertising and marketing research firm.</p>

    <p class="tx">Indirect measures of campaign effectiveness rely on counting the sales generated by the campaign,
      using operational data. The marketing department needs reports that track</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">sales volume,</li>
      <li class="bl">repeat purchases,</li>
      <li class="bl">new customer activity,</li>
      <li class="bl">purchases by specific market segments,</li>
      <li class="bl">purchases in specific geographic areas,</li>
      <li class="bl">change in order sizes, and/or</li>
      <li class="bl">source of new sales (to measure message channel effectiveness).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">When marketing campaigns include an offer that is specific to the campaign and make a unique and
      trackable call to action, measurement is relatively straightforward. Consider, for example, a radio commercial for
      Acme&#x2019;s thingamajigs that announces &#x201C;20% off all orders received by June 1&#x201D; paired with the
      call to action, &#x201C;Mention WGN Radio to receive your discount when you call.&#x201D; Each caller who mentions
      WGN when placing an order can be counted as a campaign response.</p>

    <p class="tx">It is more difficult to measure the effect of marketing that does not make a specific call to action,
      because the effects are slower to accumulate and rarely can be directly attributed to specific campaign elements.
      The effect of image advertising, sponsorships, and other public relations efforts are hard to track. Even so,
      research with a sample of members of the target population can reveal changes in their ability to recall brand
      attributes or specific product benefits. Presumably, an increase in recall of positive attributes can be claimed
      as a &#x201C;win&#x201D; for the marketing strategy, just as tangible sales results can.</p>

    <p class="tx">Measuring the results of marketing processes is critical for two reasons:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"> to provide feedback on marketing strategy and execution, to improve with the next cycle of the
        marketing process; and</li>
      <li class="nl"> to prove the marketing department&#x2019;s contribution to the success of the organization, to
        ensure operational and financial support.</li>
    </ol>

      through measurement.</p>

      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Returning once more to the frozen dinner business niche, consider the hypothetical business you
        described in response to the questions at the end of Section 2.4. You were asked what blend of mass-market,
        targeted, or one-to-one message channels would be most effective in reaching your target customers. Now consider
        measurement of that campaign. What measures might allow you to compare the performance of those channels against
        each other?</p>
    </div>

    <a id="p65"></a>
    <h2 class="Case-Study h2" id="ch02casestudy"><strong>Case Study: </strong><em>Love at First Taste</em></h2>

    <p class="tx">Look in your cupboard&#x2014;do you have a package of Knorr soup, a stock cube, or maybe a sauce mix?
      Knorr is Unilever&#x2019;s largest food brand. At 178 years old, its products aren&#x2019;t exactly identified
      with youth. When the brand&#x2019;s managers decided on a strategic objective of repositioning Knorr to attract
      millennials, it was time to put the marketing process in gear. </p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Analysis:</em> Initial analysis brought to light that millennial consumer behavior is decidedly
      food-forward. A Mintel market research study found that over 60% of millennials identify as
      &#x201C;foodies&#x201D; (34% for all ages). They spend 14 times as much on food as the average person. Nearly 90%
      say that even when money is tight, they splurge on food (Morgan, 2017). </p>

    <p class="tx">All Knorr needed to do to promote its convenience-oriented product line (skillet meals, soups, side
      dishes, and sauce and stock mixes) to millennials was to draw their attention to the brand. Unilever engaged
      advertising agency MullenLowe London. Rebecca Morgan, chief strategy officer,&#xA0;described the campaign for
      Knorr, called Love at First Taste, in a case study published on CampaignLive. In that report, she described
      millennials&#x2019; use of food for expression and as a status symbol&#x2014;for example, posting photos of food
      to Instagram. But millennials are also known for &#x201C;questioning everything that the established food brands
      were offering,&#x201D; Morgan wrote. &#x201C;It had become increasingly difficult to drive equity and penetration
      among the new generation of foodies&#x201D; (Morgan, 2017, para. 6).</p>

    <p class="tx">Knorr conducted its own consumer background research, asking 12,000 people in 12 countries about what
      flavor meant to them. &#x201C;One of the key findings of Knorr&#x2019;s research was that three in four people
      (over 78% in fact) are more likely to be attracted to someone who enjoys the same flavors&#x201D; (Unilever, 2016,
      para. 7), according to a press release on the Unilever website. </p>

    <p class="tx">That research held the clue that would lead MullenLowe&#x2019;s creative team to the campaign strategy
      Knorr selected for execution.</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Marketing strategy:</em> MullenLowe&#x2019;s millennial campaign targeted three objectives. </p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"> Connect emotionally (rather than focus on the product, as Knorr had done in the&#xA0;past). </li>
      <li class="nl"> Increase brand equity, as measured by recommendation, differentiation, and market&#xA0;share.
      </li>
      <li class="nl"> Get them talking about Knorr, as measured by online mentions. </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">What strategy would they use to attain those objectives? &#x201C;We found our idea on the dating sites
      and we are not ashamed to admit it,&#x201D; Morgan (2017, para. 20) wrote. The advertising agency planned to link
      flavor, personality, and love to get millennials talking about Knorr. This led to a two-part strategy: Develop the
      Flavor Profiler, an online quiz, and conduct a social experiment and film it, resulting in a video. Both
      components would be highly sharable on social media. The intent of the two components was to build an
      &#x201C;ecosystem&#x201D; that would earn free exposure. </p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Campaign development:</em> The campaign was given the name Love at First Taste. Knorr built the
      Flavor Profiler using artificial intelligence technology to classify site visitors as one of 12 flavor personality
      types. To create the video content, Knorr conducted a social experiment, pairing strangers (millennials, of
      course) for a first date. The couples were matched using the Knorr Flavor Profiler. The intent of the research was
      to see if shared food preferences could &#x201C;create chemistry between the couples&#x201D; (Unilever, 2016,
      para. 8). After meeting each other before the cameras, the couples were given a surprising instruction&#x2014;they
      would have to feed each other the entire meal set before them. The awkward and often amusing results of the
      experiment were captured in Knorr&#x2019;s <em>Love at First Taste</em> video. Additional content was generated
      with a <em>Behind the Scenes</em> video and updates as the participating couples produced video &#x201C;date
      diaries.&#x201D; </p>

    <a id="p66"></a>
    <p class="tx"><em>Execution:</em> Knorr used YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter to drive conversations and shares that
      would bring consumers to the Flavor Profiler on the Knorr website. People who completed the quiz would receive
      recipe recommendations tailored to their flavor profile. First, the campaign was rolled out to social media
      influencers via a sneak preview with exclusive content. Then, the content was launched via social media. </p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Measurement:</em> Social media benchmarks were tracked, including average completion rate, average
      click-through rate, and average share rate. The campaign garnered 2.5 earned (free) impressions for every paid ad
      impression. (The distinction between earned and paid media is discussed in Chapter 6.) <em>Love at First
        Taste</em> became the most-chosen-to-watch video on YouTube in May 2016 and second-most-viewed YouTube video ad
      that year. Over 1.2 million people used the Profiler worldwide, &#x201C;meaning voluntary exposure to the
      brand,&#x201D; said Morgan (2017, para. 30). The campaign won a Gold award in Effective Content Strategies at the
      2017 World Advertising Research Center Awards (World Advertising Research Center, 2017). In 2016 it won a Silver
      award in the Effies, a worldwide competition to honor the most effective marketing communications ideas, in the
      categories of Brand Experience and Food (Oakes,&#xA0;2017). </p>

    <h2 class="eoc-h2" id="ch02keyideas">Key Ideas to Remember</h2>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Marketing takes place in the context of macro marketing, company strategy, and marketing department
        operations. Decision support tools like the BCG Matrix and Ansoff&#x2019;s Matrix help marketers design the
        business portfolio and select growth strategies for strategic business units. Marketing supports the
        company&#x2019;s overarching objectives as defined in its strategic plan.</li>
      <li class="bl">The marketing process consists of situation analysis, selection of a marketing strategy, and
        development of campaign strategy, followed by execution and measurement. This process fits into the larger
        picture of business operations by connecting consumers and producers of the business&#x2019;s products and
        services. </li>
      <li class="bl">Marketers conduct research to provide the specific information necessary to make marketing strategy
        decisions. Research helps marketers to discover opportunities, learn about market segments, make decisions, and
        measure the impact of campaign executions. The result of the marketing strategy step is selection of a market
        segment to target and a value proposition to appeal to that segment.</li>
      <li class="bl">To develop campaigns, marketers apply decisions about the marketing mix, select a strategy
        regarding message channels, and develop creative messages to convey an underlying value proposition. The fast

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"> Do you think marketing strategy should drive the rest of a company&#x2019;s operations or not?
        Support your position.</li>
      <li class="nl"> Describe your cell phone in terms of the benefits it delivers. Assume you are the target market
        for a new upgraded phone from the same company. Write three survey questions that could help you test what new
        features should be included in the upgrade, based on the benefits you&#x2019;ve identified.</li>
      <li class="nl"> Take the upgraded cell phone product from the previous question and decide whether it is best
        suited to a mass-market campaign, targeted message channels, or one-to-one marketing. Give the reasons for your
        decision.</li>
      <li class="nl"> You are a marketer for a large shoe retailer. You have a database that includes information about
        customers&#x2019; past purchases&#x2014;date of purchase, style, size, and price point, as well as e-mail
        addresses and opt-in permission to receive marketing messages. Describe the steps involved in executing a
        marketing campaign triggered by customer data using one-to-one messaging.</li>
      <li class="nl"> You&#x2019;ve learned that reasons for measuring the marketing process include providing feedback
        on marketing strategy and execution to improve the marketing process and proving the marketing
        department&#x2019;s contribution to the success of the business. Is one of the reasons for measuring results
        more important than the other? Why?</li>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="ch03intro">Introduction</h1>


    <p class="tx">The subject of what marketers sell&#x2014;the goods and services on offer and the packaging, customer
      service, brand reputation, and more that surround them&#x2014;is covered by the term <em>product</em> as one of
      the four Ps of marketing management. Under the umbrella term <em>marketing mix</em>, the four Ps of product,
      place, price, and promotion represent the elements of a strategy that marketers control. This chapter, and the
      three that follow it, will take up the topic of each P in turn.</p>

    <p class="tx">This chapter focuses on concepts necessary to understand strategic decisions about products, but we
      are not talking merely about the tangible goods that come home from stores in boxes. Product strategy encompasses
      all the elements that enable a product to serve its owner. The size and shape of a potato peeler&#x2019;s handle,
      the location of menus in a software application, the brightness of a car&#x2019;s headlights, the quality of
      manufacture that makes a Yeti cooler more desirable than a Styrofoam ice chest&#x2014;these are all elements of
      form that render service. As you learn about offerings ranging from pure goods to pure services and about where
      new products come from and the life cycles they experience, keep in mind that every purchase transaction has its
      roots in service-dominant logic. Seen in this light, the product P is really an S for <em>service-product = good
        or service</em>.</p>


    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec3.1">3.1&#x2002;Designing Products for Customer Value </h1>

    <p class="tx">When we say &quot;products,&quot; what exactly are we talking about? The AMA defines the term as a
      &quot;bundle of attributes (features, functions, benefits, and uses) capable of exchange or use; usually a mix of
      tangible and intangible forms&quot; (<a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://Marketingpower.com">Marketingpower.com</a>, 2001). Thus, a <strong>product</strong> may be a
      physical entity, a service, an idea, an experience, or any combination thereof. An organization, person, place,
      experience, or idea can be a product.</p>


    <p class="tx">Consider Ellen DeGeneres: The comedian creates entertainment content through her production company (A
      Very Good Production) and markets a lifestyle brand (ED by Ellen), among other business ventures. The apparel and
      home goods sold by ED by Ellen are physical products. The content on <em>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</em> is
      technically a digital output&#x2014;and as an experience, it too is a product. For her fans, being in the audience
      during a taping of the show is thrilling; seats in the television studio are a product for sale as well. And
      finally, Ellen&#x2019;s core idea of charitable behavior, captured in the catchphrase with which she closes each
      program (&quot;Be kind to one another&quot;), is an idea as product that anchors the entire Ellen DeGeneres brand
      experience in the humanity-centric world of Marketing 3.0. </p>


    <p class="tx">Table 3.1 demonstrates that all product offerings can be positioned somewhere on a continuum from pure
      good (composed of tangible attributes) to pure service (composed entirely of intangible attributes). To identify a
      product&#x2019;s position on this continuum, consider if anything is taking up space after you make the purchase.
      With a bar of soap, the answer is definitely yes. With completion of a medical exam, the answer is no.</p>

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. All products for sale occupy a position somewhere on the continuum from
      pure good to pure service.</p>


    <p class="tx">The tangibility of pure goods can create the illusion that people purchase them solely to take
      possession of physical objects. Not true&#x2014;behind every purchase is the desire for a benefit that derives
      from possession, as was discussed in Chapter 1. This reflects the current marketing thought regarding
      service-dominant logic&#x2014;the understanding that customers buy offerings that render services (Lusch &amp;
      Vargo, 2007). Over the past decades, the view that products could be classified on a continuum has been augmented
      with this understanding that even pure goods have value only to the extent that they render service (utility) to
      their owners. Tangibles like soap and salt serve their owners, for example, by loosening dirt or enhancing the
      flavor of a dish.</p>


    <p class="tx">All products on the continuum shown in Table 3.1 fall into two broad classifications: those bought by
      consumers and those bought by businesses to make products for consumers. Consider the humble paper clip.
      Individuals and families&#x2014;especially those including students&#x2014;buy a box from time to time. But do
      they buy a shrink-wrapped cube of 12 boxes? Rarely. The big-volume purchasers of paper clips are businesses. Until
      the modern office goes completely paperless, the simple bent wire will be consumed by the case to organize the
      paperwork in the offices that manage the making of products for consumers.</p>


    <p class="tx">Where can we begin to study the marketers&#x2019; perspective on all these &quot;somethings&quot; for
      sale, as diverse as Ellen DeGeneres and a paper clip? The answer lies in a fundamental concept introduced in
      Chapter 1. All products, whether tangible or intangible, are designed to deliver customer value. Designing
      products for customer value means putting into the product enough features that deliver the benefits customers are
      looking for but not so many that the product costs more than customers are willing to pay. As you learned in
      Chapter 1, customers are increasingly being invited into cocreation of value, which removes some of the guesswork
      from the question &quot;What do customers want and what are they willing to pay for it?&quot; </p>


    <p class="tx">As consumers, all of us expect the things we buy to deliver a certain degree of reliability and
      fitness for use at a reasonable price. The more reliable the offering is and the better its functionality, the
      higher the price we are likely to consider reasonable. When a company gets the balance between value and price
      right, customers say, &quot;Now, <em>that</em> is a good deal.&quot; </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.1.1">Consumer Product &quot;Marketing Fails&quot; </h2>

    <p class="tx">Unsuccessful examples are likewise educational. Google Glass was unceremoniously withdrawn from
      Google&#x2019;s new product lineup in 2016. Tech industry observers generally agree that the failure resulted from
      inadequate research on consumer behavior and attitudes. While the idea of a ubiquitous computer housed in a
      hands-free device worn like a pair of eyeglasses seemed promising, the fact that it housed a camera caused privacy
      concerns to top the list of reasons it failed. Poor design, lack of a clear functional purpose, high purchase
      price, and a marketing strategy that backfired helped push it into its grave. </p>

    <a id="p76"></a>
    <p class="tx">The design was considered &quot;geeky&quot; at best, and possibly dangerous. &quot;Please tell me if
      I&#x2019;m being paranoid here but isn&#x2019;t the small, sharp-edged cube of glass placed directly in front of
      my very delicate eye an accident waiting to happen?&quot; wrote Karsten Strauss (2013, para. 3) in a
      <em>Forbes</em> product review). </p>


    <p class="tx">Functionality would appear to be a given with any device that promises to be a &quot;ubiquitous
      computer&quot;&#x2014;but almost everyone already carries a mobile device that delivers the functions Google Glass
      offered. Even the engineers who designed it couldn&#x2019;t agree on what its unique functional advantage was
      (Doyle, 2016). </p>


    <p class="tx">Now let&#x2019;s look closer at the failed marketing strategy&#x2014;which includes its high purchase
      price, one of marketing&#x2019;s four Ps. At $1,500 for a product that was barely out of beta testing, the product
      failed to resemble &quot;a good deal&quot; for most potential buyers. Recognizing that, Google Glass was promoted
      exclusively to early adopters. &quot;Unfortunately, this group was comprised mainly of tech geeks and journalists
      who wouldn&#x2019;t really benefit from the key features that Google Glass had to offer,&quot; wrote Bob Doyle
      (2016, para. 14) on <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://Business2community.com">Business2community.com</a>. (He named as primary features the ability to
      have a feed of information available at a glance and to quickly capture images.) &quot;The worst part was the fact
      that some tech geeks and journalists are very opinionated people, and they do have the habit of sharing their
      experiences. . . . Consequently, the underwhelming experience . . . damaged its reputation prematurely&quot; added
      Doyle (2016, para. 17).</p>


    <p class="tx">But don&#x2019;t be surprised if Google Glass makes a comeback: In the summer of 2017, Alphabet
      (Google&#x2019;s parent company) announced a Google Glass product for the workplace that allows wearers to shift
      between actual and virtual views. Google Glass Enterprise, as the redesigned product is known, solves a problem
      for workers who need two hands free while accessing or inputting digital information. In settings as disparate as
      airline factories and doctors&#x2019; offices, Google Glass Enterprise is increasing productivity and accuracy. By
      shifting from targeting consumers to targeting business buyers (a shift in marketing strategy), Google has been
      able to recover from its &quot;marketing fail&quot; and breathe new life into its innovation (Levy, 2017). </p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.1.2">Product Strategy: Three Perspectives</h2>

    <p class="tx">Imagine that you have been invited to sit in on a strategy session of the Acme Paper Clip
      Company&#x2019;s new product development committee. In the room are Eugene from engineering, Sally from sales, and
      Alvin from accounting.</p>


    <p class="tx">As an engineer, Eugene&#x2019;s perspective on paper clips is purely focused on what paper clips are
      and do&#x2014;the form they take and the functionality they deliver. As a salesperson, Sally&#x2019;s perspective
      is more expansive. She thinks about the paper clip&#x2019;s value as customers perceive it&#x2014;not just how the
      paper clip attaches paper, but the price and the packaging that go into the product, that make it easier for her
      to sell. Alvin from accounting sees the paper clip purely in terms of what it does for the company. He&#x2019;s
      counting costs against income to calculate profit, worrying about liability issues and wondering what will happen
      to Acme Paper Clip if paper clips become obsolete in the future.</p>


    <p class="tx">These three points of view add up to a <strong>product strategy</strong> for Acme Paper Clip. A
      product strategy describes the product offering from three perspectives: core, expanded, and concept, as shown in
      Figure 3.1.</p>

    <div class="figure-box">
      <h4 class="figure-name">Figure 3.1: Product strategy perspectives</h4>
      <h5 class="figure-title">The three perspectives of the product strategy are increasingly comprehensive.</h5>
      <img src="figures/fig_3.1.jpg"
        alt="Illustration showing the three perspectives of the product strategy: core product, expanded product, and product concept."
        title="Illustration showing the three perspectives of the product strategy: core product, expanded product, and product concept."
        class="figure" id="fig_3.1">
    </div>


    <p class="tx">The <strong>core product</strong> describes the product in terms of its solution for sale&#x2014;the
      form/function utility that creates the set of benefits that allow it to fill a need. Acme offers paper clips with
      features like a nonskid surface, colored coating, and heavier gauge of metal, giving its paper clips a range of
      advantages in form/function utility.</p>


    <p class="tx">The <strong>expanded product</strong> description includes the mix of tangible attributes and
      intangible product support that come with the product. This includes how the product is packaged, plus all the
      factors categorized as part of &quot;ease of possession,&quot; one of the four utilities of customer value
      discussed in Chapter 1. The expanded product (referred to by some marketers as the augmented product) includes the
      price, payment plan, and any warranties or guarantees that go with a purchase. What differentiates one offering
      from others on the market, beyond form/function utilities? The expanded product, which establishes the
      customer&#x2019;s perception of its value equation. Acme uses packaging to augment its product&#x2019;s value by
      selling assorted colors of vinyl-coated paper clips in plastic tubs with internal dividers to keep the different
      colors separate. It offers a money-back guarantee and discounts for bulk orders. These features of the expanded
      product are designed to increase their paper clip offerings&#x2019; value in consumers&#x2019; eyes.</p>

    <a id="p78"></a>
    <p class="tx">Finally, the <strong>product concept</strong> is the company&#x2019;s long-range perspective on the
      product. It describes the market niche to be served by this product, the life cycle it will experience in the
      marketplace, and the impact of manufacturing and selling it on the company itself. Consumers&#x2019; perception of
      the brand, the company&#x2019;s social responsibility in producing it, and customers&#x2019; experience with the
      company after they make the purchase all contribute to the product concept. Acme Paper Clips is carefully
      monitoring the office paper industry and other indicators of trends in business consumption of its humble product
      and conducting innovation research in search of products that offer value in paperless office environments.</p>


    <p class="tx">These three perspectives form the product strategy&#x2014;the product P in the four Ps of the
      marketing mix.</p>


    <p class="tx">Consider how Trader Joe&#x2019;s Candy Cane Joe Joe&#x2019;s (an Oreo-like cookie product) would be
      described in terms of the three perspectives of core product, expanded product, and product concept. The core
      product is a tasty, generously stuffed chocolate&#x2013;peppermint cookie. The expanded product is the affiliation
      of one cookie with all products sold under the Trader Joe&#x2019;s <strong>private label</strong>, a widely
      trusted seal of approval. The product concept, the &quot;big idea&quot; behind this tasty treat, is Trader
      Joe&#x2019;s corporate strategy of creating exclusive private-label products that compete with national brands on
      price to gain a long-term competitive advantage (<em>Private Label Magazine</em>, 2009).</p>


    <p class="tx">Now let&#x2019;s take a trickier example: the business networking service LinkedIn. Can you define
      this company&#x2019;s three product strategy perspectives? Its core product is its customers&#x2014;specifically,
      the ability of members to connect with other members. The more members LinkedIn has, the more valuable its core
      product becomes to those same customers. LinkedIn&#x2019;s expanded product includes the free and premium
      membership levels it offers, with &quot;perks&quot; at each level designed to meet the needs of different types of
      users. The majority of LinkedIn&#x2019;s members never pay for membership, but it&#x2019;s the existence of this
      large pool of professionals that gives the platform value for marketing, sales, and recruiting (Baxter, 2015).
      LinkedIn&#x2019;s product concept comprises its strategy to focus on the needs of people in the niches that value
      the premium features enough to pay for them. </p>

      <p class="photo-caption">Decisions about branding, packaging, support, and quality give products points of
        competitive differentiation by which consumers can compare options and assess value.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.1.3">Product Strategy Captures Value</h2>

    <p class="tx">The product strategy is made up of dozens of decisions. Marketing strategists choose which market the
      product will serve and what the product will do for the people in that market. Other departments make decisions
      about manufacturing processes and materials sourcing, which affect the cost to produce the product and thus how it
      can be priced. All these decisions come together in a product strategy that allows an offering to stand out from
      similar items for sale, due to specific promises of service utility designed to appeal to specific market
      segments.</p>

    <a id="p79"></a>
    <p class="tx">The product strategy defines the limits of what the product will do, to avoid promising to be all
      things to all people. When consumers know exactly what a product will do, they can put a value on it. Only then
      can they differentiate between several offerings and decide which option best suits their needs.</p>


    <p class="tx">The goal of the product strategy is to achieve competitive differentiation. This takes discipline.
      Decisions add up to a strategy that promises that one product offering delivers value that no competing product
      does. When a product is truly designed for customer value, it can command a premium price. That is a
      company&#x2019;s reward for taking a disciplined approach to competitive differentiation.</p>


    <p class="tx">Marketers&#x2019; decisions that affect customer value can be grouped into four areas.</p>


    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">branding&#x2014;a company&#x2019;s use of its name, reputation, and trademark to attract
        consumers&#x2019; attention</li>
      <li class="nl">packaging&#x2014;form attributes designed to attract the eye, prevent damage in shipping, and
        convey information to serve both the sellers&#x2019; and the buyers&#x2019; needs, like nutrition labels and UPC
        codes</li>
      <li class="nl">support&#x2014;postsale services and policies that create customer satisfaction by affirming that a
        company stands behind its products</li>
      <li class="nl">quality&#x2014;technical conformance to a standard set by experience, enabling the offering to
        render the service for which it is intended; more quality creates a better value for the consumer, delivering
        greater satisfaction with the purchase</li>
    </ol>


    <p class="tx">Think about the product strategy for Yeti coolers, the popular but pricey ice chests first designed
      for hunting and fishing enthusiasts that began showing up at beaches, football tailgate parties, and even as
      permanent car accessories for ferrying groceries. Yeti&#x2019;s brand has the cachet of a luxury good (Kurutz,
      2017). Its attention to packaging is similarly high end. For example, Yeti vacuum-insulated tumblers are packaged
      with a combined label and information sheet that, rather than sticking to the mug where adhesive residue could
      linger, wraps around to adhere to itself and thus can be cleanly removed (Gintzler International, 2014). Yeti
      offers product support unheard of with the typical coolers and tumblers retailed through mass
      discounters&#x2014;Yeti gear comes with a 3- to 5-year warranty, depending on the item. Yeti makes quality the
      differentiating feature of its product strategy. By using a rotational molding process, it delivers far greater
      insulating properties and rugged durability; the same process is used to mold kayaks (Kurutz, 2017). A
      well-manufactured product, wrapped in supportive policies and thoughtful packaging, marketed like a luxury good,
      appears to be a highly successful strategy for Yeti. </p>

    <a id="p80"></a>
    <p class="tx">To summarize, here&#x2019;s how product strategy creates the customer&#x2019;s perception of an
      offering&#x2019;s value equation: From the manufacturing company&#x2019;s point of view, product strategy begins
      with identifying a target market and a need to fill. Then, strategic decisions about the core product, expanded
      product, and product concept fill out the picture of what that product is and does. Decisions about branding,
      packaging, support, and quality give the product its positioning and points of competitive
      differentiation&#x2014;how a consumer can compare it to similar options and decide its value. </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.1.4">Product Classifications: The Marketing Orientation</h2>

    <p class="tx">To those who manufacture and sell products, their output can be classified as <strong>items</strong>,
      which are part of product <strong>lines</strong>, which make up the <strong>assortments</strong> of goods on
      offer. These terms are defined as follows.</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Items: Individual products with specific characteristics; one item equals one SKU (stock-keeping
        unit).</li>
      <li class="bl">Lines: A set of closely related individual products.</li>
      <li class="bl">Assortments: All the lines and products a company sells, also called its product mix.</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="tx">Note that this terminology differs slightly from that used in the discussion of designing a business
      portfolio in Chapter 2. That concerned how a manufacturing company or retailer looks at products. But in any
      company, the marketing department plays the crucial role of representing the customer. Marketers are the ones who
      keep their buyers&#x2019; (and end users&#x2019;) perspective in mind, bringing a marketing orientation
      (introduced in Chapter 2) into every discussion of business strategy. Holding this perspective can be difficult;
      it&#x2019;s all too easy to slip into the habit of seeing the company&#x2019;s products from an internal vantage
      point. That&#x2019;s why it is important to understand the difference between manufacturers&#x2019; and
      marketers&#x2019; thinking about products.</p>


    <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s start our examination of these different points of view by looking at how marketers
      classify products into distinct groups. Classification matters, because marketers sell different products to
      different people in different ways. Marketing decisions about branding, product strategy, and positioning will all
      be based on the class in which a specific product fits.</p>


    <p class="tx">Products can be categorized by the type of customer the company sells them to: <em>consumers</em> or
      <em>businesses</em>. The terms <strong>B2B</strong> and <strong>B2C</strong>&#x2014;abbreviations for
      &quot;business to business&quot; (B2B) and &quot;business to consumer&quot; (B2C)&#x2014;are frequently used in
      marketing to describe these two sales orientations, so it&#x2019;s good to be familiar with them. B2B describes
      transactions between businesses, such as between a manufacturer and a wholesaler or between a wholesaler and a
      retailer. B2C describes transactions between businesses and consumers. A less frequently used term is B2G, for
      business-to-government transactions.</p>


    <p class="tx">Products for consumers are classified based on the way people shop, while products for businesses are
      classified based on how the product will be used.</p>

    <a id="p81"></a>
    <p class="tx">A B2C company sells products that fall into four categories, based on how consumers make buying
      decisions.</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"><em>Convenience:</em> These products are inexpensive, frequently needed, and easily substituted by
        something else. Consumers buy with a minimum of comparison or effort. Example: soap.</li>
      <li class="nl"><em>Shopping:</em> These products are less frequently needed and typically evaluated based on
        suitability of style or image. Consumers compare brands, price, and quality. Example: clothing.</li>
      <li class="nl"><em>Specialty:</em> These products require a high investment and are infrequently needed. Consumers
        research and make careful comparisons. Example: cars.</li>
      <li class="nl"><em>Unsought:</em> These products can be new innovations or simply not a high consumer priority.
        Consumers must be convinced to want them; their purchase can easily be deferred. Example: funeral services,
        reference books.</li>
    </ol>


    <p class="tx">To some extent, B2B products can also be classified based on how business consumers shop for them. A
      purchasing manager will likely shop for printer paper like a convenience product but for a computer printer like a
      specialty product.</p>


    <p class="tx">A B2B company sells products that other businesses buy, which fall into seven categories.</p>


    <ol class="nl">

      <li class="nl"><strong>Raw materials</strong>: Basic substances in their natural, modified, or semiprocessed
        state, used as an input to a production process.</li>
      <li class="nl"><strong>Component parts</strong>: Pieces, assemblies, or subassemblies that are required to finish
        an activity, item, or production process.</li>
      <li class="nl"><strong>Process materials:</strong> Substances purchased for incorporation into a product, which
        cannot be recognized in the finished activity or item.</li>
      <li class="nl"><strong>Manufacturing installations</strong>: Assemblies or systems required to conduct
        manufacturing processes, usually custom-designed and installed.</li>
      <li class="nl"><strong>Accessory equipment</strong>: Assemblies purchased for use in production, administrative,
        clerical, or marketing activities, not directly used as an input to a production process.</li>
      <li class="nl"><strong>Operating supplies</strong>: Items used in production, maintenance, or administrative
        activities.</li>
      <li class="nl"><strong>Business support services</strong>: Activities required for successful completion of a
        process or to support administrative functions.</li>
    </ol>


    <p class="tx">To understand these categories, consider a mustard company. It buys mustard seeds and spices (raw
      materials); plastic bottles (component parts); laundry soap for washing the workers&#x2019; uniforms (process
      materials); a bottling line (manufacturing installation); a photocopier for the office (accessory equipment); copy
      paper (operating supplies); and finally, the services of an accountant, an advertising agency, and a food
      distributor (business support services). </p>


    <p class="tx">Most companies specialize in selling products, services, or a combination that fit one niche in either
      the consumer or business product classification, as shown in Table 3.2.</p>

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. Companies sell products, services, or a combination thereof that fit one
      niche in either the consumer or business product classification.</p>


    <p class="tx">The marketing orientation leads us to keep customers&#x2019; needs and desires in mind. Frequently,
      filling those needs and desires creates demand for other goods and services. If consumer demand for Gatorade
      sports drinks increases, PepsiCo (which owns of Gatorade) will need to increase production, leading to demand for
      plastic bottles, caps, and labels, not to mention for labor at the bottling plant and distribution capacity to get
      all that Gatorade to retailers. This is termed <strong>derived demand</strong> because need springs from the
      demand for something else. Business buyers don&#x2019;t purchase a printer and paper because they want to own
      them&#x2014;they buy them because they help their company construct its end product.</p>


    <p class="tx">Now let&#x2019;s take product classification a step further. To a marketer, it makes more sense to
      look at how consumers shop and use items. Marketers gain insights into how to promote products when they think of
      them in the following classifications.</p>


    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><strong>Usage groups</strong>: Items that go together to fill a need.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Complementary products</strong>: Items whose use is related to the use of the original
        product to fill a need.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Substitute products</strong>: Offerings that have some characteristics in common with the
        original item considered and that could stand in for the original in filling a need.</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="tx">For an example of a usage group, look no further than the grocery store. If you want to have a
      cookout, it&#x2019;s not enough to buy just hot dogs. You&#x2019;re also going to need buns, pickles, ketchup, and
      mustard. Without those items (and sauerkraut and onions), you don&#x2019;t have an all-American hot dog with the
      works.</p>


    <p class="tx">Complementary products for your cookout might include disposable plates and utensils, grilling tools,
      charcoal, and a tablecloth. You can make a hot dog sandwich without them&#x2014;but your cookout will go better if
      you bring these complementary products too.</p>


    <p class="tx">Substitute products are the marketer&#x2019;s bane&#x2014;the items consumers settle for when they
      perceive the usage group or complementary products are not a good enough value. Many a cookout is downgraded to a
      mere meal outdoors by substitution of a bag of fast food replacing the usage group and complementary products
      required to cook and serve a picnic.</p>


    <p class="tx">Marketers create more effective promotional strategies when they keep in mind these concepts. In the
      spring of 2011, Vlasic created a marketing campaign that focused on its pickles&#x2019; role as part of the
      &quot;cookout&quot; usage group. The company placed ads for Vlasic pickles in grocery stores, putting in-store ads
      on shelves near the meat section, hamburger buns, and cheese case and on shopping carts as well (Newman, 2011c).
      Without insight into classification of products, the marketers at Vlasic might have missed this opportunity to
      increase pickle sales.</p>

    <p class="tx">Regardless of the niche(s) in which a company offers its products, the strategy around them will
      spring from marketers&#x2019; understanding of product classifications and their view of each product in terms of
      its core, expanded product, and product concept.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.1.5">Product Strategy in Action</h2>

    <p class="tx">In the summer of 2011, a flawed strategy resulted in misuse, injury, and a swift recall of a product.
      As the outdoor season approached, Napa Home &amp; Garden marketed decorative firepots that burned a pourable fuel
      gel. But problems emerged when consumers used the fuel gel improperly to refill the firepots. Packaging for both
      the fuel gel and firepots carried warnings not to refill the pots when lighted or even hot, but the consumer
      typically discarded the packaging. When time to refill came around, the instructions were long gone. After users
      of the product reported several serious injuries, Napa Home &amp; Garden pulled both the fuel gel and firepots
      from store shelves with the intention of redesigning the packaging. The product (which marketers would classify as
      a consumer product usage group because of its relatively low cost and similarity to other products such as candles
      and oil lamps) was recalled within weeks (Halbfinger, 2011a, 2011b).</p>


    <p class="tx">In this case the product strategy failure was not with the core product or the product concept but
      specifically with part of the expanded product&#x2014;the packaging. Because the product was a recent innovation,
      consumers weren&#x2019;t familiar with its safe use. They needed instructions where it mattered&#x2014;on the
      product itself.</p>


    <p class="tx">You&#x2019;ve now learned how product strategy supports the quest to design products for customer
      value through decisions about the core product, expanded product, and product concept. You&#x2019;ve learned the
      importance of giving the product points of competitive differentiation through branding, packaging, support, and
      quality. You&#x2019;ve explored classification schemes from the seller&#x2019;s point of view (B2C or B2B) and the
      shopper&#x2019;s point of view (usage groups, complementary products, and substitute products). <em>Field Trip
        3.3</em> offers an opportunity to practice using these concepts.</p>

    <p class="tx">Keeping in mind the concept of service-dominant logic, we must not lose sight of the service rendered
      by products, even those that are pure goods. All offerings for sale&#x2014;at any point on the continuum from pure

      into marketing approaches for services as distinct from tangible goods. But first, a fundamental concept needs
      discussion: the product life cycle.</p>

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec3.2">3.2&#x2002;Managing Product Life Cycles</h1>

    <p class="tx">Every product on the market has a life span. A product begins with an original idea. If all goes well
      and the company gets the idea to market while the timing is favorable, the product enters the growth phase. Other
      companies take notice and introduce competing products. Either the rivalry either stimulates new product
      strategies that keep the product thriving or the product moves on to decline.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers describe the product life cycle in four phases. Figure 3.2 depicts a product&#x2019;s
      contribution to the manufacturer&#x2019;s bottom line during each of the four stages, listed below.</p>


    <ul class="nl">
      <li class="nl">market introduction</li>
      <li class="nl">growth</li>
      <li class="nl">market maturity</li>

        class="figure" id="fig_3.2">
    </div>


    <p class="tx">During the <strong>introduction</strong> phase, investment costs accrue but are not yet recouped (that
      is, costs are high, but sales and profits are low). During <strong>growth</strong>, sales rise as costs fall, due
      to efficiencies as the scale of production increases. The expenses of product introduction are recouped. In
      <strong>maturity</strong>, both costs and sales (and profits) are stable. Once <strong>decline</strong> begins,
      both costs and sales decrease. Therefore, it&#x2019;s important for a company to have products in the growth
      and/or maturity phases and to predict decline before its onset; otherwise, it is difficult to remain profitable.
    </p>


    <p class="tx">Two trends&#x2014;increasing price competition at retail and decreasing manufacturing
      time-to-market&#x2014;are shortening the product life cycle. Thus, competitive differentiation is growing in
      importance.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.2.1">Product Life Cycle: Examples</h2>

    <p class="tx"><em>Market introduction:</em> In the early 1980s two Minnesota brothers brought to market
      Rollerblades, an improved in-line skate designed to fill a need for off-season hockey training. That introduction
      led to a whole new category of sports equipment for recreational and professional team use. Marketing action
      focused on reaching innovators who would try the new training tool.</p>


    <p class="tx"><em>Growth:</em> Darlene Tenes started CasaQ in 2007 to produce a line of Christmas ornaments for
      people who embrace Latino culture. By focusing her marketing energy on a defined niche, Tenes&#x2019;s product
      launch went well. Before long, competitors took notice. Three years later, bigger companies are starting to copy
      her designs, but Tenes&#x2019;s marketing savvy and roots in Hispanic culture have helped her maintain the growth
      of her company (Tenes, 2018).</p>

    <a id="p86"></a>
    <p class="tx"><em>Maturity:</em> Mattel&#x2019;s Hot Wheels toy cars have been popular since their introduction in
      1968. To sustain the product in its maturity and stave off decline, Mattel began targeting adult buyers by
      extending the line with Hot Wheels clothes, video and online games, a TV show, and experiential marketing at
      events like the Indianapolis 500 race (Elliott, 2011a).</p>


    <p class="tx"><em>Decline:</em> Harry &amp; David, the Oregon-based company founded in 1910 that practically
      invented the mail order fruit business, began experiencing unexpected sales decline as the
      &quot;farm-to-table&quot; ethos arose in the 21st century. The profusion of new choices, more locally sourced,
      took the shine off Harry &amp; David&#x2019;s products. The company installed an &quot;orchard cam&quot; to create
      a more tangible connection between consumers and growers, part of a concerted marketing effort to counteract
      declining sales (Gordinier, 2011).</p>


    <p class="tx">As these examples show, those who plan for their products&#x2019; life cycles will avoid harsh
      surprises when one phase gives way to the next. Recall what you learned about the BCG Matrix in Chapter 2: the
      question marks, defined as high-growth but low-share SBUs, typically consist of products/services that are in the
      introduction and growth phase of the product life cycle. Companies avoid having too much of their business
      portfolio invested in products that are vulnerable to decline by investing in innovation of and marketing for
      question marks. </p>


    <p class="tx">Product life cycles can be months or years. It is important for the company to recognize the stage in
      which the product is in. Pricing strategies and development strategies are based on this information. </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.2.2">Diffusion of Innovations Theory</h2>

    <p class="tx">The product life cycle focuses attention on a product&#x2019;s contribution to a company&#x2019;s
      profitability. The marketing orientation encourages us to look at that same life cycle&#x2014;but this time with
      customers in mind. How are the buyers for a product different at each stage in the product life cycle? Their
      consumer psychology&#x2014;and thus their patterns of adoption&#x2014;varies in predictable ways. The
      <strong>diffusion of innovations theory</strong> explains the mechanism by which subsequent waves of buyers
      generate sales throughout a product&#x2019;s life span. The differentiator is innovativeness&#x2014;the degree to
      which an individual adopts a new idea (Rogers, 2003). </p>


    <p class="tx">Products in the introduction stage attract buyers who are <em>innovators</em>, who like to think
      independently and take risks. <em>Early adopters</em> soon follow, moving the product into its growth stage.
      Products in the maturity stage are bought by those who are generally more traditional in their preferences and
      less willing to take risks. This large segment of buyers can be divided into <em>early majority</em> and <em>late
        majority</em>. <em>Laggards</em> are the last to try anything new and typically adopt a product only as it is
      about to reach decline&#x2014;or already has. Diffusion of innovations theory is best seen as a descriptive tool,
      with limited utility in predicting outcomes (Clarke, 2011). </p>


    <p class="tx">But more than psychology determines diffusion of innovations. Other factors affecting the speed at
      which an innovation is adopted include price, risk, and effort (known as switching costs, discussed in Chapter 5).
      A higher price can slow adoption if the consumer doesn&#x2019;t see sufficient value. Early adopters were quick to
      buy iPhones and even Google Glasses, but only in the former case was that momentum sufficient to sustain a product
      life cycle (Levy, 2017). </p>

    <a id="p87"></a>
    <p class="tx">Risk can become a factor in several ways&#x2014;reputational, as when people wearing Google Glasses
      were perceived to be &quot;creepy&quot; because the product allowed them to take photos surreptitiously, or
      financial, as when a product requires an &quot;ecosystem&quot; that may or may not develop around it, like Blu-ray
      players requiring entertainment companies to distribute media on Blu-ray disks. Sometimes the switch requires the
      consumer to learn new skills, such as switching from a bicycle to a Segway. Segways attracted early adopters, but
      all three factors&#x2014;price, risk, and effort&#x2014;probably contributed to their poor adoption by the
      subsequent categories of customers.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.2.3">New Product Development</h2>

    <p class="tx">The best defense against declining sales due to product life cycle issues is a good offense: the
      development of new products. The new product development process takes a brand-new idea, proves its potential, and
      brings it to market, as shown in Table 3.3. During <em>idea generation</em>, ideas enter the process from sources
      such as customers, retailers, the sales force, and independent inventors. In <em>screening</em>, ideas are judged
      against company objectives; some organizations maintain detailed checklists of standards new product ideas must
      meet. The <em>evaluation</em> stage brings detailed analysis to assess the idea&#x2019;s potential market,
      competitive strengths, and market potential. This step will determine the product&#x2019;s target market, service
      utility, competitive differentiation, and the financial and technical requirements it must meet to support company
      objectives. Product ideas that pass this stage proceed to <em>development</em>, including engineering for form and
      function. Finally, the <em>rollout</em> stage arrives&#x2014;typically in test markets first, followed by
      full-scale marketing.</p>

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. The new product development process generates an idea and brings it to
      market.</p>


    <p class="tx">Many companies&#x2019; ideas for new products come from an internal department responsible for
      generating new ideas. Other companies actively solicit ideas from their customers or the public at large&#x2014;a
      method that has grown rapidly with the onset of Marketing 3.0 and greater appreciation of consumers&#x2019; role
      in cocreation of value through products and experiences that satisfy their needs or wants (Prahad &amp; Krishnan,
      2008). A few companies operate as &quot;idea labs&quot; that match inventors with companies seeking new product
      ideas.</p>


    <p class="tx">Introducing new products is a necessary activity for businesses that wish to avoid the shrinking
      profits associated with products in decline. Some companies resist new product development, fearing the adverse
      effects of <strong>cannibalization</strong>&#x2014;a situation in which the sales of new items eat into the sales
      of other products already in the market. When Apple introduced iPhones with the capacity to play music files, it
      surely expected that move would cannibalize sales of its iPod music player line. Some companies take an opposite
      tack&#x2014;a strategy of <strong>planned obsolescence</strong>. In this approach, product strategists
      deliberately retire an item before the end of its useful life by cutting off supply or service. In its place will
      be introduced a newer model, with the objective of prodding consumers to trade the old for the new. Both
      strategies, valid in certain circumstances, point to the importance of planning for existing products&#x2019; life
      cycles and strategically timed new product introductions.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.2.4">Adaptive Innovation</h2>

    <p class="tx">Businesses are increasingly shifting to an adaptive innovation approach (introduced in Chapter 1) to
      get new products to market faster, without sacrificing confidence in a successful rollout. The adaptive innovation
      approach invites customers into cocreation at the idea generation stage and keeps them involved throughout the
      rest of the process. The Nike+ website is one example: On the platform, customers post data, access maps, and
      share with their friends about their recent running activity. Customers get increased engagement and interaction
      around their running, while Nike receives valuable data about its customers and their product usage. That
      information drives innovation efforts. And because the data collection and analysis is ongoing, Nike can rapidly
      respond should its customers&#x2019; behavior begin to change.</p>

      <p class="photo-caption">PepsiCo created different versions of its Mountain Dew. How did the company market to a
        particular niche group?</p>
    </div>

    <a id="p89"></a>
    <p class="tx">The adaptive innovation approach focuses on releasing pilots and prototypes before full-scale rollouts
      take place. During prototyping, companies frequently experiment with multiple variations simultaneously, to see
      which ones experience the most success with consumers (Gupta, 2016). This leads to new cycles of pilots and
      prototypes.</p>


    <p class="tx">Rather than treating the rollout as the end of the process, adaptive innovation is iterative. The
      product development team continues to add, modify, or delete features based on the ongoing customer conversation.
      In this way a company keeps new products in its business portfolio, balancing the need to adapt to
      consumers&#x2019; rapidly changing purchasing behavior with the need to control investment in innovation.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.2.5">Line Extension Lessens Cost </h2>

    <p class="tx">Launching new products is not the only way to generate new sales. Companies can give new life to
      existing products by developing a <strong>line extension</strong>. The high cost associated with developing and
      introducing a new product can be avoided when a marketer spots an opportunity to adapt an existing product to suit
      new niches in the same market, or finds an entirely new market that can be served by the existing product.</p>


    <p class="tx">Examples of adapting an existing product to suit new niches abound in the soft drink aisle. Mountain
      Dew (a Pepsi product) exists in versions including regular, diet, caffeine-free, and caffeine-free diet to suit
      those who appreciate its citrus flavor. Additional variants in fruit flavors including Code Red and Diet Code Red
      (fruit punch), LiveWire (orange), and Baja Blast (tropical lime) bring Mountain Dew products to a new niche
      uninterested in its original citrus flavor profile.</p>


    <p class="tx">Palm Products of Melbourne, Australia, a manufacturer of plastic drinkware, discovered an opportunity
      for line extension at a trade show. Managing director and designer Robert Wilson was working on a stable, nonslip,
      unbreakable drinking glass for boaters. He looked at other outdoor situations in which these attributes would be
      beneficial and realized campers have similar needs to boaters but deal with an added obstacle of low or no light.
      He came up with a glow-in-the-dark drinkware product line, choosing a glowing shade of green for its emotional
      connection to the environment.</p>


    <p class="tx">Palm Products uses trade shows to reach distributors and retailers. Lara Blamey, marketing manager,
      exhibited the line as part of a larger product assortment at a hospitality industry trade show. The camping line
      brought two orders on the first day from senior-care facilities, which saw the advantage of a glow-in-the-dark
      glass to residents who wake up thirsty in the night. Blamey (2011) said:</p>

    <a id="p90"></a>
    <p class="ext">When we got back to the office in Melbourne, we started calling the suppliers to the hospitality
      industry and letting them know about the glow-in-the-dark drinkware and its suitability to senior care. The
      suppliers identified another market: nightclubs! They saw a novelty as well as a practical safety. In just a few
      months our camping range went from a high-concept introduction to being stocked at 70-plus sporting goods stores,
      used at senior-care facilities in three states in Australia, and increasingly sold to nightclubs. </p>


    <p class="tx">The product life cycle, an immutable fact of life for companies (regardless of product or service
      orientation), has three specific implications for marketers. These spring from advances in technology that
      increase both the speed and reach of business. </p>


    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">First, product life cycles are becoming increasingly brief. Companies that quickly get their
        product to market first make the most profit. </li>
      <li class="nl">Second, companies must invite collaboration with consumers, who are eager to experience the
        engagement in cocreation. </li>
      <li class="nl">Third, marketers must now take a global perspective. New product ideas can come from outside
        markets; likewise, products in a mature or declining phase in the home country can achieve new life when
        introduced into an outside market.</li>
    </ol>


    <p class="tx">To summarize: Every product experiences a four-stage life cycle in which sales begin, climb, mature,
      and decline, each requiring investment and to varying degrees contributing profit to the company. Buyers at
      different stages are characterized by somewhat different personalities and motivations, as identified by the
      diffusion of innovations theory. That theory also delineates factors affecting the speed at which a new innovation
      is adopted, including price, risk, and effort. Because almost all products eventually decline, every company needs
      to make new product development an institutionalized, ongoing process. Cocreation and adaptive innovation keeps
      that new product development function attuned to consumers&#x2019; changing needs and desires. Line extension is a
      strategy that generates additional sales of an existing product by adapting it to suit new niches in the same
      market or finding a new market the existing product can serve.</p>

    <p class="tx">You&#x2019;ve been there&#x2014;standing in the toothpaste aisle at the drugstore, facing down an
      overabundant array of product options. Do you need extra whitening power, more tartar control, or both? What
      flavor do you prefer&#x2014;spearmint, cinnamon, or original? Can you even find the same package that you bought
      last time? Too much choice can make consumers feel anxious.</p>

    <a id="p91"></a>
    <p class="tx">Barry Schwartz described the problem in his 2005 book, <em>The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is
        Less</em>. He argues that too much choice creates anxiety and depression, brought on by the daunting task of
      evaluating every alternative.</p>


    <p class="tx">A study on choice, conducted by Columbia Professor Sheena Iyengar and reported in Schwartz&#x2019;s
      book, revealed that customers given too many choices were 10 times less likely to make a purchase. Her research
      team set up a free tasting of jams in a grocery store. Sometimes they offered 6 jams and other times they offered
      24. When choosing from 6 jams, 30% of tasters made purchases; when offered 24 options, only 3% of tasters
      purchased a jam. Iyengar&#x2019;s research concluded that having too many options can leave buyers less inclined
      to buy and more dissatisfied with their choices when they do (Schwartz, 2005).</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.3.1">What&#x2019;s a Marketer to Do?</h2>

    <p class="tx">Where did all these choices come from? Why do manufacturers of consumer goods keep placing their bets
      on developing more offerings? To some extent they are simply managing the product aspect of their marketing mix.
    </p>


    <p class="tx">Many companies have responded to their products&#x2019; life cycles with the safe choice of line
      extension, rather than innovation. When purchases of Crest&#x2019;s original mint flavor start to fall,
      it&#x2019;s easier for Crest to extend the line with a new flavor than to discover an innovation in tooth care and
      persuade consumers to accept it.</p>


    <p class="tx">When market research reveals that customers would value a toothpaste that pampers sensitive teeth
      while it whitens enamel and freshens breath, that product goes into development, and soon a new box squeezes onto
      that toothpaste display in the grocery aisle. As consumers, we asked for it&#x2014;but once it&#x2019;s there, the
      proliferation of choices can make us anxious.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.3.2">Stand Out Among &quot;Good Enough&quot;</h2>

    <p class="tx">A fundamental problem facing marketers today is that most offerings are essentially &quot;good
      enough.&quot; Goods and services that are seriously flawed quickly wash out in a marketplace already crowded with
      reasonably good alternatives, as shown by the example of the firepot and pourable fuel.</p>

      <p class="photo-caption">Product parity challenges marketers to create a link between positive emotions and the
        company&#x2019;s identity. An athlete who wears Nike displays that he or she has a &quot;Just do it &quot;
        philosophy too.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">The effect of <strong>product parity</strong>, as this situation of many &quot;good enough&quot;
      offerings is termed, is to challenge marketers to create differentiation in other ways than through product
      features and benefits. In a world of product parity, marketers must leverage consumer emotions through
      <strong>branding</strong>, which creates a link between positive emotions and the identity of a company and its
      products. Branding lifts a simple offering into the realm of feeling and self-expression. For consumers, it
      connects &quot;I buy this&quot; with &quot;I am this.&quot; By wearing running shoes emblazoned with the Nike
      &quot;swoosh,&quot; an athlete can display that he or she, like Nike, believes in the &quot;Just do it&quot;
      philosophy. The concept of branding is discussed in depth in Chapter 6.</p>


    <p class="tx">In the Marketing 3.0 world, where consumers reach for fulfillment of their higher needs through their
      buying decisions, marketers are discovering a new way to differentiate their products and help consumers overcome
      the anxiety created by the paradox of choice. Cause-related marketing, introduced in Chapter 1, is one such
      method. Cause-related marketing involves strategically positioning a company to link its brand with a social cause
      or issue. The technique works for businesses of all sizes but is most frequently used by businesses that sell to
      consumers. Cause-related marketing is less common among businesses that sell to other businesses.</p>


    <p class="tx">Corporate social responsibility takes cause-related marketing a step further, integrating concern for
      social and environmental well-being into the fundamental mission of the company. Companies like Ben &amp;
      Jerry&#x2019;s, which has been committed to a three-part mission from its start, is a prominent example. Founders
      Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield wanted to (a) make the world&#x2019;s best ice cream, (b) pursue progressive social
      change, and (c) provide fair compensation to employees and shareholders. They fought to maintain that commitment
      after purchase by Unilever in 2000&#x2014;and largely succeeded (Edmondson, 2014). </p>


    <p class="tx">Unlike cause-related marketing, which is primarily a brand positioning strategy used in
      consumer-facing marketing, corporate social responsibility like that of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s is effective
      regardless of whether a company is B2C or B2B&#x2014;or both. Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s owns and operates
      consumer-facing scoop shops but primarily markets to grocery stores. </p>


    <p class="tx">Another way to stand out among good enough is the use of <strong>experiential
        marketing</strong>&#x2014;encounters that connect consumers with brands through experiences that create lasting
      impressions. Experiential marketing is discussed further in Section 3.5, <em>When the Product Is an Idea</em>.</p>

    <a id="p93"></a>
    <p class="tx">The age of product parity, in which most offerings are able to render the desired service and line
      extensions have brought a confusing array of choices to store shelves, has made it imperative for marketers to
      achieve competitive differentiation. When all products are good enough, differentiating through product features
      and benefits is not enough. Marketers must also leverage consumer emotions through other techniques, like
      branding, experiential marketing, and cause-related marketing, that create a community around a product that
      connects &quot;we buy this&quot; with &quot;we support this.&quot;</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Identify a product or service advertised in your community that is using a cause-related tie-in to
        differentiate itself from similar offerings. Describe how the marketing campaign you identified addresses the
        paradox of choice.</p>
    </div>


    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec3.4">3.4&#x2002;When the Product Is a Pure Service</h1>

    <p class="tx">At the beginning of this chapter, Table 3.1 depicted product offerings on a continuum from pure goods,
      like soap or salt, to pure services, like haircuts or hotel stays. While some things offered for sale fall at the
      ends of this continuum, most consumer offerings are a mix of good and service. A restaurant meal, for instance,
      combines food (a good) and the work of a kitchen and wait staff (a service).</p>


    <p class="tx">In many ways, a marketer&#x2019;s product strategy for a service is no different from that for a
      tangible product. Just like goods, services must deliver customer value. As consumers we expect the services we
      buy to deliver reliability and fitness for use at a reasonable price, just as we do with products.</p>


    <p class="tx">The three perspectives that make up product strategy are essentially the same with pure services.
      Marketers describe service offerings from the same three perspectives of core, expanded, and concept. Marketers
      think about a service in terms of how it fills a need (core service), how it is differentiated from other
      competing options and establishes its value (expanded service), and the company&#x2019;s long-range strategy
      surrounding it (service concept).</p>


    <p class="tx">The fundamental marketing insight of service-dominant logic&#x2014;that people buy what they buy
      because they want the benefits that derive from the purchase&#x2014;holds true with services as well as products.
      Looked at this way, there is no difference; both are simply means of delivering a &quot;solution for sale.&quot;
      But in some ways, a service is very different from a good.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.4.1">How Services Differ From Goods</h2>

    <p class="tx">Services don&#x2019;t come in a box&#x2014;there&#x2019;s nothing new to take home after purchasing a
      service. That fact raises several issues from a marketing perspective. Four characteristics of services set them
      apart from products. Services are</p>

    <a id="p94"></a>
    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">intangible,</li>
      <li class="nl">inseparable,</li>
      <li class="nl"> variable, and</li>
      <li class="nl">perishable.</li>
    </ol>


    <p class="tx">Because services are intangible, it&#x2019;s hard for buyers to &quot;kick the tires&quot; before they
      buy. Services are sold on a promise of satisfaction that requires more faith on the buyers&#x2019; part than
      purchase of a good. Therefore, service marketers must make an offering tangible through clues to its reliability
      and fitness for use, such as testimonials from satisfied customers, visual representations of processes, and so
      on.</p>


    <p class="tx">Services are inseparable from the individual and the organization that provides them. Unlike a good
      that is manufactured, sold, and taken home in a box, most services are &quot;manufactured&quot; by a seller and
      consumed or received by the buyer at the point of sale. The quality of the interaction between service provider
      and customer is an essential part of the customer value equation.</p>


    <p class="tx">Related to inseparability is variability. Unlike goods, where items come off the assembly line
      essentially identical, services vary with the person providing them. Uniformity in services is a factor that each
      service owner tries for. For example, food chains like Subway, Chipotle, Pizza Hut and Domino&#x2019;s have major
      challenges of providing same quality for every order (Bhasin, 2017).</p>


    <p class="tx">If every day you order a Starbucks latte tall, dry, and skinny, you&#x2019;re likely to come to
      believe that some baristas make your drink better than others. To counter the variability that arises from
      inseparability, companies invest in extensive staff training to increase consistency of service.</p>


    <p class="tx">Services are perishable because they typically can&#x2019;t be stored until a buyer comes along.
      Suppose you are a photographer with an appointment for a family portrait at 3:00 p.m. If the family fails to show
      up for the sitting, you can&#x2019;t sell 3:00 p.m. to another client. With every elapsing minute your inventory
      of time is perishing. Businesses throughout the hospitality industry deal with the perishability of services
      through peak and off-peak pricing. Perishability is a significant problem for businesses facing fluctuating
      demand. For example, restaurants must hire extra staff members to keep service quality up to expectations during
      peak dining hours.</p>


    <p class="tx">A company that leveraged perishability to create a new service is Zipcar, the by-the-hour car rental
      company whose motto is &quot;Wheels when you want them&quot; (Zipcar, 2018). Membership-based Zipcar, founded in
      2000, provides automobile reservations to its members, billable by the hour or day. The solution for sale by
      Zipcar is the ability for an individual or family to possess fewer cars through renting an extra vehicle when
      needed. &quot;Wheels when you want them&quot; gives Zipcar a clear point of differentiation from conventional car
      rental companies, with their focus on multiple-day rentals.</p>

    <a id="p95"></a>
    <p class="tx">These four characteristics that set services apart from goods require specific responses in
      marketers&#x2019; product strategy.</p>


    <ul class="bl">

      <li class="bl">Counter <em>intangibility</em> with differentiation; for example, a brand image that sets your
        offering apart.</li>
      <li class="bl">Transform <em>inseparability</em> into an opportunity to build loyalty by empowering frontline
        employees to throw in &quot;extras&quot; or otherwise customize the service.</li>
      <li class="bl">Minimize <em>variability</em> with training for consistent service quality, especially across
        multiple locations.</li>
      <li class="bl">Offset <em>perishability</em> by managing for productivity; for example, using technology to
        forecast demand.</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="tx">But let&#x2019;s take a moment to view these characteristics through the macro marketing lens. One in
      particular&#x2014;perishability&#x2014;has led to human resource practices that have drawn concerns about unfair
      labor practices. The use of on-call staffing with retail service employees had unintended consequences that led to
      pushback and in some cases changes in management policy.</p>


    <p class="tx">To reduce labor costs from overstaffing, many retail and restaurant chains began using data-driven
      software to match the number of workers scheduled during a work shift with predicted customer demand. These
      companies required employees to be prepared to come in for a shift but canceled that shift on short notice when
      the software predicted lower customer demand than anticipated. The practice did indeed reduce labor costs but led
      to fierce criticism from employees and labor activists. For workers who had to juggle child care and other
      personal commitments&#x2014;even other jobs&#x2014;the burden was great. When in 2014 the <em>New York Times</em>
      profiled a Starbucks employee whose life was adversely affected, broad concern grew. Inquiries from states&#x2019;
      attorneys have led to many companies backing away from the on-call staffing approach (Halzack, 2016). Deploying
      technology that replaces human labor for customer service, such as self-checkout stations, appears to be a better
      solution to perishability, one that satisfies both consumers&#x2019; desire for speed and convenience and
      retailers&#x2019; need to control labor costs (Karolefski, 2015).</p>


    <p class="tx">While intangibility can be countered with branding, inseparability with customization, and variability
      with training, perishability remains a challenge. It is difficult to design a marketing response that benefits
      both customers and employees.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.4.2">Services for Consumers and for Businesses </h2>

    <p class="tx">As with classes of goods, the class in which a specific service fits affects marketing decisions about
      it. Like goods, service offerings can be divided into those sold to consumers (B2C) and those sold to businesses
      (B2B).</p>


    <p class="tx">Everything sold is accompanied by a service encounter. Even retailers of products must focus on
      service, because service is part of what causes a consumer to choose one retailer over another. In 2011, the
      appliance retailer H. H. Gregg launched a marketing initiative to attract buyers by focusing on product training
      of its sales staff. While H. H. Gregg recognized that competitive pricing and product selections were important,
      it realized customer service was a factor on which it could base its competitive differentiation. That strategy
      grew from the insight that customers were looking for knowledge about product features to help them make their
      choices (Olson, 2011).</p>

    <a id="p96"></a>
    <p class="tx">Like the B2C companies that sell goods, consumer services can be classified into the four categories
      of convenience, shopping, specialty, and unsought, based on how consumers make buying decisions. B2B
      companies&#x2019; service offerings can be categorized as distribution or consulting, as shown in Table 3.4.</p>

      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. Most service providers sell offerings that fit one niche in either the
      consumer or business classification of services.</p>


    <p class="tx">Distribution services involve the function of breaking bulk, assembling lots, and creating
      assortments, which are discussed in Chapter 4. Consulting services involve offering expertise that a client
      company needs occasionally but not on a continual basis. Consultants provide solutions in four broad areas:
      finance, operations, marketing, and personnel, as the following examples illustrate. Accountants serve the
      financial area; plumbers fit under operations; an advertising agency assists the company&#x2019;s marketing
      department; a provider of temporary employees fills a need in the personnel category. It may be a stretch to think
      of janitors, plumbers, groundskeepers, and the like as &quot;consultants&quot;&#x2014;but keep in mind our
      definition. Consulting services are any that a company needs occasionally but not on a continual basis.</p>


    <p class="tx">Most service providers specialize in selling an offering that fits one niche in either the consumer or
      business classification. Like services sold to consumers, B2B services must be understood in terms of their
      intangibility, inseparability, variability, and perishability if they are to be marketed successfully.</p>


    <p class="tx">A growing trend in the marketing of B2B offerings describes product/solution bundles as
      &quot;solutions,&quot; which renders the boundaries between product/service classifications less clean. This word
      choice conveys the service-dominant logic underlying the sales pitch, recognizing as it does that all prospective
      buyers are, on a fundamental level, seeking a solution to a defined problem.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.4.3">Service Strategy in Action</h2>

    <p class="tx">Consider the hospitality industry. For consumers of overnight stays, the &quot;product&quot; is a mix
      of amenities with nothing new to take home (except perhaps the complimentary toiletries). Every hotel guest
      expects a bed and a bathroom. The business strategy for any hotel or multihotel chain builds from a target
      customer&#x2014;anywhere from bargain to luxury traveler&#x2014;and a customer value proposition that dictates
      what amenities, at what price, will make up the service offering. Travelers who stay in Red Roof Inns choose a bed
      for the night based on the reliability, fitness for use, and price of the service they&#x2019;ll receive, just as
      those who stay in a Kimpton boutique hotel do.</p>

    <a id="p97"></a>
    <p class="tx">Both hoteliers deliver a &quot;solution for sale,&quot; investing resources to deliver a level of
      comfort and a quality of experience that meets consumers&#x2019; expectations. Kimpton may provide an assortment
      of amenities, such as wireless Internet access, complimentary breakfast, and pillow-top mattresses, while Red Roof
      Inn provides little more than free parking and a loyalty reward program. Both are the result of fundamental
      strategic decisions that help each company achieve competitive differentiation within its target market niche.</p>


    <p class="tx">For another example, consider TaskRabbit, a company created to address the needs of two groups of
      people: those who need help with occasional tasks and those who want to earn extra money without the commitment of
      a regular job. </p>


    <p class="tx">TaskRabbit&#x2019;s service consists of listing tasks (in categories like personal assistant,
      delivery, cleaning, handyman, and assembly) that freelance workers accept. The business strategy for TaskRabbit is
      to attract and serve two target customer groups that each become the supplier of what the other wants. Ideally,
      both benefit from the value proposition. And yet, the characteristics of services&#x2014;intangibility,
      inseparability, variability, and perishability&#x2014;could undermine this business model if not carefully
      managed.</p>


    <p class="tx">Similar &quot;task-matching&quot; companies include Thumbtack, Porch, <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://Pro.com">Pro.com</a>, and Amazon Home Services. </p>

        strategists of TaskRabbit in terms of their service&#x2019;s intangibility, inseparability, variability, and
        perishability?</p>
    </div>


    <p class="tx">TaskRabbit, like LinkedIn, is an example of a service company operating in the <strong>platform
        business model</strong>. Companies like these create value for multiple interdependent groups (TaskRabbit terms
      its two groups &quot;Clients&quot; and &quot;Taskers&quot;), using a digital platform (typically a mobile app and
      website) to automate the interface between users from the two groups. The success of this business strategy
      depends on being able to generate enough customers to take advantage of the <strong>network effect</strong>, in
      which the value of the service increases with every member added. Without a balance of supply and demand between
      taskers and clients, TaskRabbit cannot grow.</p>


    <p class="tx">TaskRabbit, which launched in 2008 as RunMyErrand, had attracted over 60,000 Taskers by 2017 when it
      was purchased by IKEA. The Swedish furniture company is beloved for its affordable, well-designed products but
      infamous for its inscrutable product assembly instructions&#x2014;a customer problem TaskRabbit is ideally
      positioned to solve. IKEA operates in 29 countries, a growth opportunity for TaskRabbit that could
      &quot;eventually be extended globally&quot; (as cited in Hsu, 2017a), the company said in a statement. </p>

    <a id="p98"></a>
    <p class="tx">As has been shown, many offerings bought by businesses and consumers are a mix of goods and services,
      while some exist purely at the service end of the continuum. For service offerings, intangibility, inseparability,
      variability, and perishability are issues that must be dealt with in addition to the product strategy decisions
      inherent in the core service, expanded service, and service concept perspectives. These issues unique to service
      offerings can be leveraged to create a compelling perception of value. Attention to differentiation counters the
      intangibility of a service, attention to empowering customer service staff can turn inseparability into loyalty,
      training can minimize variability, and attention to productivity (often through technology) can offset
      perishability.</p>


    <p class="tx">Regardless of whether services are sold individually or bundled into solutions; regardless of whether
      they are offered to consumers, businesses, or a blend of both; regardless of whether they market to one group or
      more in a platform business model; pure services must deliver customer value.
    </p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">It can be harder to sell an intangible service than a tangible product. Pick one of the cells in
        Table 3.4 and name a service offering in that class&#x2014;for example, business remodeling service under
        Consulting (Operations). Describe a service in your chosen category in terms of the four ways a service is
        different from a product&#x2014;its intangibility, inseparability, variability, and perishability. Does one of
        these aspects suggest a solution for sale that could be used as a point of competitive differentiation in a
        marketing campaign?</p>
    </div>



    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec3.5">3.5&#x2002;When the Product Is an Idea</h1>

    <p class="tx">Consider a box of soap: It is clearly a good. But what about a &quot;soapbox&quot;? In some
      situations, what one person is trying to get another to buy is not a product or a service, but an idea.</p>


    <p class="tx">When we think of marketing as spreading the word about ideas, we generally think of
      nonprofits&#x2014;groups like the Red Cross or the American Cancer Society that hope to &quot;sell&quot; the
      public on the idea of making a behavior change, like starting to donate blood or ceasing to smoke cigarettes. But
      this kind of marketing activity, known as <strong>social marketing</strong>, is a subset of the larger picture of
      selling ideas as if they were products to be consumed.</p>


    <p class="tx">When the product is an idea, the solution for sale is usually a change in thought, belief, or
      behavior. The idea can be commercial, community, or cause related, depending on who is &quot;selling&quot; and
      what market they&#x2019;re selling to.</p>


    <p class="tx">When the &quot;sale&quot; of an idea or belief benefits a company, delivering profits to the bottom
      line on the balance sheet, we think of that as a commercial idea. When the &quot;sale&quot; creates community
      among a group of people, we consider it a community idea; the benefits can accrue to both a commercial company and
      the public. When the solution for sale benefits the public good, we consider it a cause-related idea.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.5.1">Commercial Ideas</h2>

    <p class="tx">With the proliferation of so much &quot;stuff,&quot; consumers are becoming more willing to spend on
      experiences that don&#x2019;t leave a product (or pile of packaging) gathering dust after interest wanes. This has
      created more opportunity for commercial offerings marketed as ideas rather than goods or services.</p>


    <p class="tx">Travel marketing is an example of the product as an idea. Journey Beyond Travel plans customized trips
      to Morocco with a promise of &quot;unique experiences in hidden corners of the country&quot; featuring
      &quot;authentic encounters that will heighten your experience&quot; ( Journey Beyond Travel, 2018). based on the
      founders&#x2019; deep relationships with locals. Journey Beyond Travel justifies its premium pricing with the
      promise that it specializes in customized, private &quot;dream trips&quot; that include accommodations,
      transportation, local guides, driver and in-country host, and some meals. Every aspect of its travel services have
      been personally vetted by company founders Fazia and Thomas Hollowell (Journey Beyond Travel, 2018).</p>


    <p class="tx">At the opposite end of the price spectrum from Journey Beyond Travel is the commercial marketing of a
      destination like Las Vegas. The &quot;What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas&quot; campaign that launched in 2003
      sold the idea of adult freedom from consequences, a rare experience available in that city. That campaign was
      designed to work with a variety of demographic and economic groups (Katsilometes, 2011).</p>


    <p class="tx">Commercial ideas are not restricted to destinations or travel experiences, of course. An example of a
      very different &quot;idea for sale&quot; is the <em>Onion</em> humor newspaper&#x2019;s tongue-in-cheek campaign
      in 2011 to win a Pulitzer Prize. Editors of the satirical newspaper mounted a full-scale multimedia campaign on
      the occasion of its 1,000th issue, publishing testimonial video pleas from unlikely supporters such as Gayle King
      (best friend of Oprah Winfrey) and the president of Georgia (Peters, 2011). The campaign for an <em>Onion</em>
      Pulitzer was likely intended to raise interest in the newspaper, which had 6 months previously begun to offer
      franchises of its print edition to local partners (Kirchner, 2010).</p>

    <a id="p100"></a>
    <p class="tx">Another example of a commercial idea is the marketing strategy called <em>image advertising</em>. This
      category of promotions, in which companies attempt to create a favorable mental picture in consumers&#x2019;
      minds, is a type of idea marketing that will be touched on in Chapter 6.</p>


    <p class="tx">Commercial idea marketing typically evokes a scene that associates an intangible benefit with whatever
      the company is selling, whether it is global travel, Vegas freedom, or awareness of a brand, like the
      <em>Onion</em>.</p>

      <p class="photo-caption">Marketers are responding to individuals&#x2019; desire for engagement by creating online
        communities that bring people together around shared interests.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.5.2">Community Ideas</h2>

    <p class="tx">In the Marketing 3.0 world, marketers recognize individuals&#x2019; desire for engagement and the
      search for deeper meaning. This trend has given rise to selling the idea of community. Companies have formed
      around the specific service of helping people find individuals with shared interests or goals. &quot;Among the
      most desired of human needs is belonging. People are willing to pay a premium and give up their privacy in
      exchange for feeling accepted and loved,&quot; wrote Baxter (2015, p. 15). </p>


    <p class="tx">The membership economy business model is functionally a community idea. Its value proposition is
      essentially the same as the platform business model mentioned earlier&#x2014;value creation through exchanges
      between two or more interdependent groups. For examples of membership economy businesses, consider marketplaces
      that match buyers and sellers, or social communities that bring people together around shared interests.
      Angie&#x2019;s List is a word-of-mouth network, created to help members find the best service companies and health
      care in their communities. The Angie&#x2019;s List website provides detailed reviews from members, searchable by
      locale. The solution for sale on Angie&#x2019;s List is trustworthy recommendations. Because of the geographical
      nature of the services reviewed, Angie&#x2019;s List puts pressure on service providers to serve their communities
      well so that customers provide positive reviews.</p>


    <p class="tx">With community ideas, it can be difficult to determine exactly who is profiting from transactions. Is
      there a company that stands to profit? Angie&#x2019;s List charges a fee to join. Member fees help ensure
      reliability, provide staff support, and fund publication of a monthly magazine.</p>


    <p class="tx">In the case of Angie&#x2019;s List, it&#x2019;s clear who&#x2019;s paying whom and why. But what about
      social communities? Consider Meetup, the social networking portal that facilitates face-to-face meetings around
      common interests. While basic access is free, the subscription fees paid by some members and group sponsors flow
      toward the privately held company&#x2019;s bottom line. LinkedIn, the online community geared toward business
      people, receives its revenues from advertising, subscriptions, and a premium membership level valuable to members
      in sales and talent recruitment. LinkedIn enables people to come together around shared interests using LinkedIn
      groups and so qualifies as a community idea.</p>

    <a id="p101"></a>
    <p class="tx">The selling of community ideas can be profitable and productive for both the company that markets it
      and the communities served&#x2014;a decent payoff for helping consumers find meaningful dialogue and engagement.
    </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.5.3">Cause Ideas</h2>

    <p class="tx">When it comes to causes, the idea for sale is getting individuals to buy into a certain behavior, for
      their own betterment or on behalf of others&#x2014;donating to a charitable cause, or voting for a particular
      political candidate, for example. Encouraging people to take care of themselves or to make behavioral changes for
      the good of the environment or society can be difficult. The practice of social marketing has emerged to apply the
      concepts and techniques of marketing to achieve specific behavioral changes.</p>


    <p class="tx">Don&#x2019;t confuse social marketing with cause-related marketing, a term that refers to a mutually
      beneficial collaboration between a company and a cause, designed to promote the former&#x2019;s sales and the
      latter&#x2019;s mission. Social marketing generates results (which may or may not be monetary) for the actual
      cause or social concern itself. Likewise, don&#x2019;t confuse social marketing with &quot;social media&quot; or a
      &quot;social media marketing plan&quot;&#x2014;terms that refer to online media channels and their use.</p>

    </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec3.5.4">How Do You Sell an Idea? </h2>

    <p class="tx">Marketers&#x2019; product strategy for selling an idea reflects the three stages targeted individuals
      must go through before they arrive at a new attitude, behavior, or belief. As these three stages progress,
      individuals</p>


    <ol class="nl">

      <li class="nl">become aware of the marketers&#x2019; message, over time coming to understand what the message is
        saying to them;</li>
      <li class="nl">change their attitudes, accepting that the message is valid and realizing they could benefit from
        it; and</li>
      <li class="nl">take action, adopting the new idea in the message.</li>
    </ol>


    <p class="tx">Marketers&#x2019; goal, with campaigns designed to sell ideas, is to help people in the target
      audience move through this change process.</p>


    <p class="tx">If the idea is new to the target audience, then marketers must begin with raising awareness. If the
      audience knows about the issue but doesn&#x2019;t really connect it to its own behavior, then marketers must work
      on changing that attitude. And finally, once the audience is informed about the issue, marketers push for action.
    </p>

    <a id="p102"></a>
    <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s walk through these steps with an example: the idea of giving a home to a child. In 1999 a
      public relations agency in Madison, Wisconsin, was hired by the state&#x2019;s Division of Children and Family
      Services (DCFS) to develop a statewide campaign to increase adoptions (Olderman, 2011). The agency first conducted
      quantitative and qualitative research to measure awareness, knowledge, and attitudes about foster care and
      special-needs adoption. Research helped reveal prevailing attitudes, so the agency could develop an appeal that
      would attract attention and a solution for sale that would persuade people to act. This example reflects the three
      stages marketers lead targeted individuals through to &quot;sell&quot; them an idea.</p>


    <ol class="nl">

      <li class="nl"><em>Raise awareness:</em> With the public relations agency&#x2019;s help, the DCFS developed
        campaign messages and materials and produced print ads, brochures, and television and radio public service
        announcements.</li>
      <li class="nl"><em>Change attitudes:</em> The agency developed an information kit that highlighted the need for
        foster care and adoption through statistics and stories.</li>
      <li class="nl"><em>Encourage action:</em> The media campaign used the oldest advertising technique to encourage
        action: It asked for the order. Posters and brochures carried the call to action: &quot;Children in Wisconsin
        need you. Call [number] or visit our website.&quot; Ads on radio, television, and in movie theaters opened with,
        &quot;Hey, I&#x2019;m talking to you!,&quot; spoken by a little girl seeking a safe and loving home, and closed
        with the same call to dial the phone or visit the website.</li>
    </ol>


    <p class="tx">The campaign was strategically crafted to move a potential adopter through the three stages of change
      by first raising awareness, then changing attitudes, and finally encouraging action. From the point of view of the
      publicity firm, the campaign was a success because the client was very pleased with its result. Evidence suggests
      the desired behavior change was achieved: adoptions increased in Wisconsin by 38% in the 5 years following the
      campaign, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Wulczyn &amp; Brunner Hislop, 2002).</p>

    <p class="tx">Selling an idea, whether commercial, community, or cause-related, generally involves creating a
      connection between the brand and its consumers. When marketers use events, product sampling, in-store (or bar or
      nightclub) promotions, or street teams to bring the experience of the brand to the public, they are using a
      technique called <em>experiential marketing</em>. The goal of this technique characterized by live encounters is
      to take individuals through the three stages described above, using memorable experiences.</p>

    <h2 class="Case-Study h2" id="ch03casestudy"><strong>Case Study: </strong><em>Agritourism</em></h2>

    <p class="tx">From 2013 to 2017 America&#x2019;s farmers and ranchers weathered a 45% drop in net farm income, a
      trend seen as likely to continue (Harvie, 2017). Given the difficulty of making a living from traditional
      (smaller, family-owned) farming, some farmers are finding a way to sustain themselves financially without off-farm
      jobs, by adding hospitality and experiences (services) to their crop production (Neuman, 2011).</p>

    <div class="photo-left">
      <img id="img3.6" class="scaled" alt="Family picking strawberries in a field."
        title="Family picking strawberries in a field." src="images/3.6.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Associated Press</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">There is little to distinguish one you-pick farm from others in the area. Competitive
        differentiation strategies depend on the marketing tactics of competitors, proximity to population centers, and
        more.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Some farms are switching to &quot;you-pick&quot; operations. Others run a seasonal corn maze or
      haunted house. Some are even adding bed-and-breakfast hospitality, known as farm stays, sharing with guests the
      experience of rural life. With income from crops augmented by fees paid by visitors and overnight guests, a small
      farm can become economically self-sustaining in a business model known as <em>agritourism</em>. The new model is
      attractive to farmers, but it is a shift that demands a new way of thinking about marketing.</p>


    <p class="tx">How should a farm business&#x2019;s product strategy change to reflect its new emphasis on services?
      Consider a hypothetical farm we&#x2019;ll call Green Hectares. Once exclusively a dairy farm, with a few acres
      rotating in corn and soybeans for animal feed, owners Oliver and Lisa have added seasonal fruit for you-pick sales
      and have turned an old farm laborer&#x2019;s cottage into attractive lodging for rent. Where Oliver and Lisa once
      sold only a product&#x2014;milk&#x2014;they now sell additional services (entertainment) and an idea (the appeal
      of rural life).</p>


    <p class="tx">Green Hectares&#x2019; milk output is purchased by a local dairy cooperative for packaging and
      processing. That classifies Oliver and Lisa&#x2019;s original product as a raw material sold to a business (B2B).
      With the addition of several consumer offerings, they&#x2019;ve added B2C to their business model. They must now
      learn how to market directly to consumers, as well as how to market services. Coming from a one-product, one-buyer
      business model, Oliver and Lisa have a lot to&#xA0;learn.</p>

    <a id="p104"></a>
    <p class="tx">You-pick fruit is a blend of good and service offerings. The consumer gets berries as well as the
      family-friendly fun of a day in the country. The core service is the experience of harvesting fruit, accompanied
      by a core product&#x2014;bowls of berries. Renting the cottage is also part of the core service offering, similar
      to a stay at any hotel, with an added experiential aspect deriving from the working-farm surroundings.</p>


    <p class="tx">In terms of the expanded product (service), the Green Hectares operation has little to distinguish it
      from other you-pick farms in the region. That is the challenge facing Oliver and Lisa, and their response depends
      on the marketing tactics of other you-pick farms, proximity to population centers, and more. Because other farms
      have not added on-farm overnight stays, lodging is a distinguishing factor Green Hectares uses to stand out. An
      afternoon spent harvesting, overnight guests enjoying the fruit of their labors . . . these are features Oliver
      and Lisa have made part of the marketing strategy.</p>


    <p class="tx">The cottage and you-pick operation combine to make up the product (service) concept of Green
      Hectares&#x2019; product strategy, the perspective describing the environment around the actual
      offering&#x2014;market niche served, consumers&#x2019; perceptions and experiences, product life cycle, and the
      company&#x2019;s long-range plans for sustainability.</p>


    <p class="tx">Where are Green Hectares&#x2019; offerings in its product life cycle? The dairy production is a mature
      product; it is unlikely to experience decline, given the relatively stable market demand for milk. You-pick
      operations have been around for decades; increasing interest in local foods, as well as the Marketing 3.0 desire
      of consumers to connect with producers, is giving this relatively mature product/service blend a fresh growth
      stage in the product life cycle. The hospitality service of Green Hectares&#x2019; new model is in its
      introductory stage. Consumer demand for farm stays is a more recent development in the United States, although
      many people who have traveled abroad are familiar with the concept and are open to trying the domestic variety.
      The overall product strategy Green Hectares develops as part of its marketing plan will reflect these product life
      cycle factors. Green Hectares&#x2019; product concept agritourism is perceived by consumers as an authentic
      experience in harmony with Marketing 3.0 values of collaboration and cocreation of value, delivering plenty of
      opportunity for participation and engagement as well as social responsibility by supporting sustainable
      agriculture.</p>


    <p class="tx">The characteristics of services that set them apart from products will present new challenges to
      Oliver and Lisa. They must respond to the intangibility of the farm-stay and you-pick ideas, the inseparability
      and variability of the farm experience on any given day, and the perishability of their service&#x2014;a major
      factor given the short productive season of their fruit crops and the limitations of their one-cottage hospitality
      operation.</p>


    <p class="tx">Luckily for Oliver and Lisa, who bring very little marketing experience to their new business model,
      clearinghouses exist to market the idea of farm stays and activities to potential consumers. Oliver and Lisa can
      list with one of these services&#x2014;an example of the product as community idea&#x2014;to raise awareness of
      agritourism, change attitudes about the desirability of simple work and relaxation in rural surroundings, and
      encourage the actions of you-pick harvesting and booking nights at the Green Hectares Cottage.</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"> Three ways of describing a product include the core product, expanded (where differentiation
        establishes value) product, and product concept; each can be structured to enhance customer value.</li>
      <li class="bl"> Marketers design value into their offerings through decisions about branding, packaging, support,
        and quality.</li>
      <li class="bl"> The inevitability of the product life cycle, especially the final stage of decline, makes it
        critical for marketers to have an institutionalized, ongoing new product development process.</li>
      <li class="bl"> The new product development process should balance needs for speed and controlled investment by
        adopting cocreation and adaptive innovation strategies.</li>
      <li class="bl"> A crowded playing field has made it more important than ever that marketers achieve competitive
        differentiation. When all products are &quot;good enough,&quot; differentiating through product features and
        benefits is no longer enough. Marketers must also leverage consumer emotions through branding.</li>
      <li class="bl"> Four aspects of service as a &quot;product&quot; demand a strategic marketing response:
        intangibility, inseparability, variability, and perishability.</li>

    <a id="p110"></a>
    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="ch04intro">Introduction</h1>


    <p class="tx">The topic of how goods and services reach customers makes up one of the four Ps of marketing
      management, the &quot;marketing mix&quot; of product, place, price, and promotion. This chapter covers the issues
      related to place, including physical logistics and distribution channel strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx">Although place is a nice mnemonic, this P has evolved considerably since the four Ps structure was
      first introduced in the 1960s. Today any organization&#x2019;s success depends not just on its own performance but
      on that of a complex web of business partners that make up the company&#x2019;s supply chain, each delivering
      value that (hopefully) improves the performance of the entire system. When we say &quot;place strategy,&quot;
      we&#x2019;re really talking about a set of mutually supporting organizations, each with a part to play in making
      goods or services available to an end user&#x2014;a consumer or business. Distribution issues are central to the
      place concept.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec4.1">4.1&#x2002;Why Place Matters</h1>

    <p class="tx">Place strategy answers the question &quot;How do I get what I sell to people who will buy it?&quot;
      Marketers must concern themselves with place issues to make strategic decisions. Place strategy is also important
      to marketers because the promises made in advertising and promotions must be supported. If advertising claims that
      &quot;you&#x2019;ll receive your order in 48 hours,&quot; a system must be in place that can get the order to the
      customer in 48 hours. That system is part of the firm&#x2019;s place strategy in its marketing mix. </p>

    <p class="tx">Today goods originate in locations all around the world, travel through distribution channels that may
      be physical or virtual, and arrive where customers can take possession of them physically or virtually. Place
      strategy has evolved from a simple matter of &quot;where shall we put the business?&quot; to an interdependent
      system that involves trade-offs between cost-efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p>

    <p class="tx">In a simpler time, when goods originated, were purchased, and were consumed or used within the same
      community, the place element of the marketing mix really was mostly a location question. A grain mill on Main
      Street America circa 1900 occupied a location close to farmers, their crops, and a stream. This put the business
      in a location close to its customers, the raw materials of production, and a power supply. The mill opened its
      doors, and farmers rolled up with their horse-drawn wagons full of grain. The mill owner applied a specific
      industrial process to it (grinding between millstones), and down the chute came flour. The farmer paid for the
      service and drove off with sacks of flour to use or sell. In this scenario, the mill business delivered customer
      value through a simple specialized service, available at a time and place convenient to customers.</p>

    <p class="tx">In the 21st century, place still matters, but our access to more distribution options has allowed that
      concept to expand. Farmers still produce grain, but their raw materials are shipped greater distances for
      processing, made into more different products for a wider array of uses, and transported to customers using rail,
      river barge, and roadways. Interdependent systems characterize place issues and always have.</p>

    <a id="p111"></a>
    <p class="tx">As you have learned in earlier chapters, marketing involves developing an offering and pricing it in
      such a way that its value attracts customers and makes a profit for the company. When customers perceive a
      suitable balance between the price and the goods or services they receive, they consider the purchase a good
      value. That balance is what we have termed the <em>customer value equation</em> (see Chapter 1).</p>

    <p class="tx">Place strategy is one of the ways a company delivers value to customers. Most firms cannot create and
      deliver that value all by themselves. Instead, they must work closely with other firms to create a system that
      delivers the value. With minimal monthly fees, Amazon Prime members have free delivery on over 100 million items
      (Business Wire, 2018). That collaboration is what gets goods and services into the hands of those customers who
      deem them a good value. Getting the partners in place to make that sale&#x2014;profitably&#x2014;is why place
      matters. </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.1.1">The Changing Language of Place</h2>

    <p class="tx">Definitions of place as part of the marketing mix often start with the proposition that the company
      must &quot;get the right goods in the right quantity to the right place for the lowest possible cost without
      sacrificing customer service&quot; (White, 2003, p. 36). This definition includes aspects of product and price,
      revealing the interdependence of the four elements of the marketing mix. Place is integrally connected with the
      other marketing mix decisions; it cannot be considered in isolation.</p>

    <p class="tx">Place is a fundamental component of marketing strategy, but that term has fallen out of favor among
      marketers. Replacing it is the word <em>distribution</em> and a suite of related concepts, including the
      following.</p>

    <ul class="bl">

      <li class="bl"><strong>Logistics</strong>: Strategies for physical distribution of raw materials or products.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Channel partners</strong>: The organizations involved in making a product or service
        available to end users. </li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Distribution channel</strong>: The relationships through which channel partners add value
        in a river-like flow that delivers goods and services from their source (raw materials) downstream toward their
        end users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">The AMA defines a distribution channel as &quot;an organized network (system) of agencies and
      institutions which, in combination, perform all the functions required to link producers with end customers to
      accomplish the marketing task&quot; (American Marketing Association, 2017). The distribution channel (also
      referred to as a <strong>marketing channel</strong>) covers &quot;the who and the how&quot; of getting value from
      producers to consumers.</p>

    <p class="tx">The various channel partners&#x2014;<em>manufacturers</em>, <em>intermediaries</em>, and
      <em>retailers</em>&#x2014;are the &quot;organized network of agencies and institutions&quot; that the AMA
      definition refers to. Many marketers refer to this group of businesses as a <strong>supply chain</strong>. An
      effective supply chain integrates marketing, sourcing, logistics, operations, and customer service. An entire
      field of specialization exists around <strong>supply chain management</strong>.</p>

    <a id="p112"></a>
    <p class="tx">This chapter is organized to emphasize the centrality of customers in place strategy. Thus, we will
      begin with the various ways offerings meet potential buyers, and then follow the distribution channel upstream to
      where the goods originate. </p>

    <p class="tx">In the language of place strategy from the customer&#x2019;s perspective, every supply chain is also a
      <strong>demand chain</strong>. A person needs a solution to a problem, which creates demand for
      <strong>retailers</strong>, which in turn creates demand for suppliers, and so on up the channel toward raw
      materials. In Chapter 1 the example of Betty needing to repair a broken chair was used to illustrate how people
      seek solutions to problems. Betty had a need for a 3/8-inch drill bit because she needed a 3/8-inch hole in order
      to insert a dowel that would repair the chair. Betty sought out a retailer of drill bits&#x2014;her local hardware
      store&#x2014;and thus initiated a demand chain. The retailer has assembled an array of related products to solve
      problems like Betty&#x2019;s, perhaps through several channel partners. Up the channel from the hardware store are
      merchandise <strong>distributors</strong> responding to the demand of their customers, hardware store buyers. And
      up the channel from distributors are the <strong>manufacturers</strong>, located all over the world, responding to
      demand by making all kinds of drills and bits. Upstream from manufacturers are the providers of raw materials,
      component parts, manufacturing equipment, and business support services, just so that manufacturers can make those
      drills and bits.</p>

    <p class="tx">Looking at distribution strategy from the demand perspective, we see that all decisions are guided by
      the service-dominant logic that says all offerings derive their value from the service they give to their end
      users. End users (customers) require a specific service utility, which drives product development and distribution
      to fill that demand, creating a demand-driven supply chain populated with <strong>intermediaries</strong> focused
      on meeting customers&#x2019; requirements.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.1.2">Logistics</h2>

    <p class="tx">Logistics concerns the physical flow of products from the point of origin to the point of consumption.
      Physical distribution strategy (logistics) involves how many and what types of storage and transportation
      resources are needed and where the storage should be located. Although advances in Internet technology have made
      possible exchange of information around the globe&#x2014;in many cases instantaneously&#x2014;most companies still
      face physical distribution challenges to get products to their customers at the right time, in the right place, in
      the right assortment.</p>

    <p class="tx">Three types of businesses come together to create physical distribution channels:</p>

    <ol class="nl">

      <li class="nl">manufacturers, who take delivery of raw materials and other purchases to make products;</li>
      <li class="nl">distributors, who provide storage and transportation functions, among other services; and</li>
      <li class="nl">retailers, who sell to consumers for personal, usually nonbusiness use. A retailer may choose a
        store or a nonstore strategy such as in-home sales, direct sales, or online retailing.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">For a musical tour of the topic of logistics, follow the link in <em>Field Trip 4.1</em> to a popular
      UPS television commercial that aired in 2010.</p>

    <a id="p113"></a>

      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 4.1: </strong><em>Logistics</em></h1>
      <p class="tx">&quot;Logistics makes the world work better,&quot; begins this commercial created by UPS in 2010.
        Follow this link to view the TV spot.</p>
      <p class="tx"><a class="link" target="_blank"
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCh6HnXHKRc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCh6HnXHKRc</a></p>
    </div>


    <p class="tx">Strategies concerning logistics have two main goals: to maximize customer service and to minimize
      distribution cost. If, for example, Sandra is looking for a new refrigerator or an artist-made carrying case for
      her iPhone, she&#x2019;ll create a demand to balance customer service with cost-efficiency in the companies she
      buys from. As a customer, she might want Sears to bring her new refrigerator <em>now</em>, before everything in
      her failed fridge spoils. However, a significant rush charge might convince her to accept some spoilage in return
      for free delivery on Sears&#x2019;s schedule. As the iPhone-toting customer of an artist on Etsy, she might want
      her new bead-embroidered case as fast as a musical download. But when she finds that her artist has orders backed
      up and won&#x2019;t be able to create and ship her customized case until next month, she has a decision to make.
      If she likes the artist&#x2019;s work well enough, she&#x2019;ll wait&#x2014;and if she&#x2019;s really impatient,
      she may even be willing to pay a rush fee to bump her order to the head of the line.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider the same purchases from the sellers&#x2019; side instead of the buyers&#x2019;. Sears handles
      the logistics of refrigerator distribution through grouping orders headed to the same side of town, charging a fee
      to customers unwilling to accommodate their cost-efficient strategy. The Etsy artist has chosen hand production
      over mechanization, accepting that the logistics of balancing supply and demand may occasionally cause an order
      backlog.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consumers are seldom aware of all the aspects of logistics affecting the availability of goods at the
      right time, in the right place. Similarly, many companies are less aware than they should be of the aspects of the
      customer value equation affected by logistics factors&#x2014;willingness to pay more for overnight shipping or to
      switch brands to avoid out-of-stock delays, for example. Successful firms evaluate all logistics with
      customers&#x2019; perspectives as well as internal operational goals in mind.</p>

    <p class="tx">Walmart&#x2019;s response to Amazon&#x2019;s purchase of Whole Foods Market in 2017 provides an
      example. Walmart introduced curbside grocery pickup in some markets, a logistics strategy designed to give it an
      edge against Amazon&#x2019;s conquest of the grocery business. Walmart customers select their groceries on its
      website, then choose a 1-hour window when they want to pick up their order. Walmart employees shop the store,
      assembling bags of items for customers who never have to leave their cars. But industry observers see a risk in
      Walmart&#x2019;s new logistics strategy: The company has used low grocery pricing to bring customers into the
      stores, where it can promote higher priced items. If the customers don&#x2019;t go into the stores, that advantage
      could be lost (Corkery, 2017). Walmart could address that concern by moving the pickup location inside the
      store&#x2014;but the further customers have to walk, the less value Walmart&#x2019;s logistics strategy offers
      them. Trade-offs like this one are common in developing a logistics strategy. </p>

    <a id="p114"></a>



    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.1.3">Adding Value Through Logistics</h2>

    <p class="tx">The logistics strategy a company chooses can enhance its customer value equation. Consider two
      potential strategies: hub-and-spoke (used by FedEx) and distributed manufacturing (used by the <em>New York
        Times</em>).</p>

    <p class="tx">FedEx created considerable value when it pioneered overnight delivery&#x2014;a promise the company
      could meet consistently, due to its development of a <strong>hub-and-spoke logistics strategy</strong> in the
      1970s. Even packages destined for relatively close cities, such as Boston and New York, travel first to the FedEx
      hub in Memphis. While this might seem inefficient, in fact the airplane headed from Boston to Memphis carries
      packages for many destinations, and the plane heading from Memphis to New York carries packages from many points
      of origin. Use of a hub-and-spoke logistics strategy gives FedEx a competitive edge in package delivery.</p>

    <p class="tx">The <em>New York Times</em> uses a <strong>distributed manufacturing logistics strategy</strong> to
      get printed copies of its paper across the nation every morning. A resident of Chicago receives a paper that was
      printed in a Chicago plant, from files shipped electronically when the day&#x2019;s edition closed in New York.
      The newspapers travel the last leg of their journey by truck to distribution points where delivery drivers collect
      and bag them, soon to fling them at doorsteps in a several-hundred-mile radius of the printing plant. Use of a
      distributed logistics strategy allows the <em>New York Times</em> to compete with local papers across the United
      States.</p>

    <p class="tx">A new technology for mass customization has created another way to add value through logistics:
      additive manufacturing, also known as 3-D printing. In this process, three-dimensional solid objects are produced
      from a digital file. A mechanical device lays down successive layers of material until the object coded in the
      digital file is completed. The range of materials that can be printed includes a wide array of metals and polymers
      (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://3Dprinting.com">3Dprinting.com</a>, 2018). Additive manufacturing is
      used to make parts closer to where they will be needed, thus reducing shipping logistics. Generating parts
      on-demand when and where they are needed also replaces the need for physical inventory &quot;Look for cloud-based
      &#x2018;virtual inventory&#x2019; to be 3D printing&#x2019;s first killer app for the supply chain,&quot; writes
      Rick Smith (2016, para. 6). </p>

    <a id="p115"></a>
    <p class="tx">Companies are also looking to other emerging technologies, like drones and driverless cars, to conquer
      &quot;the last mile&quot;&#x2014;the logistics of the final leg from a delivery hub to the end user. Today this
      task falls most frequently to commercial delivery services and the U.S. Post Office. The rise of e-commerce has
      increased consumer demand for delivery of physical goods at speeds rivaling that of digital downloads (Joerss,
      Neuhaus, &amp; Schr&#xF6;der, 2016). All this means that Walmart&#x2019;s curbside pickup may have to compete with
      drone grocery deliveries in the future.</p>

    <p class="tx">While use of 3-D printing technology is growing, and autonomous vehicles may soon provide &quot;last
      mile&quot; delivery, goods are still rarely needed at precisely the moment they&#x2019;re manufactured and in
      precisely the location where they are made. Companies develop place strategies to manage how items will be stored
      and transported to achieve a balance of supply and demand. Marketers get involved (consulting with operations
      managers and other key decision makers) to ensure the balance of cost and customer service delivers an acceptable
      customer value equation. </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.1.4">Reverse Logistics</h2>

    <p class="tx">Physical distribution is not a one-way street. Logistics must accommodate flows in both directions.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">On the surface, a distribution channel flows only one direction, from producers toward end users, but
      that is not always the case. Not only do goods have to reach customers; sometimes they have to move from the
      customer to the manufacturer or from the customer to the provider for processing or repair. For example, sometimes
      distributors, retailers, or customers need to return broken, unwanted, or excess products to the manufacturer. In
      some cases, companies accept discarded products for recycling as a customer service. A logistics strategy is not
      complete until there is a plan in place accommodating the flow of goods in <em>both
        direc</em><em></em><em>tions</em>. The return trip, or <strong>reverse logistics</strong>&#x2014;defined as all
      activity associated with a product or service after the point of sale&#x2014;seeks to optimize postsale activity
      to save money and environmental resources.</p>

    <p class="tx">Many retailers treat merchandise returns as individual transactions with few implications for
      operating efficiency or marketing impact. Companies that can shorten the link from return to the time of resale,
      by following best practices in returns management, can achieve gains in both operations and customer retention.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">The fundamental goal of place strategy is to add value without increasing the price customers must
      pay. Finding a distribution strategy that reduces cost or adds to customer service is one way to achieve that
      goal. </p>

    <a id="p116"></a>
    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">UPS claimed that &quot;logistics makes the world work better&quot; in its 2010 commercial (see
        <em>Field Trip 4.1</em>). UPS identifies logistics as a relevant business idea to firms of every size; all must
        get their products from here to there. UPS is hoping companies will make its services part of their distribution
        channel. However, the examples of FedEx and the <em>New York Times</em> show that logistics can be accomplished
        without outsourcing to channel partners like UPS. Describe how owning versus buying physical distribution
        affects the aims of physical distribution strategy: greater customer service and/or reduced distribution cost.

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec4.2">4.2&#x2002;Retail: Where Customers Meet Sellers</h1>

    <p class="tx">Retailing has been with us since peddlers roved among our ancestors, hawking their wares. Today
      retailing takes highly diverse forms, including <strong>bricks-and-mortar stores</strong>, ranging from specialty
      shops to discount houses, and nonstore retailers selling online, in homes, and through various forms of direct
      marketing. What all retailers have in common&#x2014;what makes them retailers by definition&#x2014;is that these
      businesses sell their wares directly to the consumer. Retailing can be extremely competitive. Wise strategic
      marketing mix decisions are essential to survival.</p>

    <p class="tx">All retailers, regardless of their sales approach, face three strategic issues that affect place
      strategy.</p>

    <ol class="nl">

      <li class="nl">market niche</li>
      <li class="nl">location</li>
      <li class="nl">merchandise assortment</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">Location is the essence of place strategy for bricks-and-mortar retailers, sitting as they do at the
      mouth of the distribution channel where the goods pour out. But the market niche a retailer targets influences
      what makes a good location. The distribution channels&#x2019; ability to deliver the merchandise assortment the
      market niche wants influences location as well. These interdependent strategic issues of niche, location, and
      merchandise assortment are driven by the precise nature of the retail business&#x2014;that is, how the business
      delivers value to customers.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.2.1">Market Niche as Part of Place Strategy</h2>

    <p class="tx">Businesses choose to target a market niche to avoid trying to be all things to all people, a strategy
      too costly to maintain because of its lack of focus or a compelling value proposition.</p>

    <p class="tx">A useful way of categorizing the world of retailing is to assess the amount of service a retailer
      provides in support of the sale. As shown in Figure 4.1, retailers fall somewhere on the axes of cost and service.
      As service increases, costs almost always go up; few businesses can manage to offer both low cost and high
      service. Likewise, few businesses operate with low service and high cost; it&#x2019;s too hard to deliver customer
      value in that equation.</p>

    <a id="p117"></a>
    <div class="figure-box">
      <h4 class="figure-name">Figure 4.1: Retail characteristics</h4>
      <h5 class="figure-title">Retailers fill a market niche somewhere on a continuum from low cost/low service to high
        cost/high service. There are not a lot of outliers exhibiting low cost/high service or low service/high cost
        characteristics.</h5>
      <img src="figures/fig_4.1.jpg" alt="A graph of businesses that provide low or high services and low or high cost."
        title="A graph of businesses that provide low or high services and low or high cost." class="figure"
        id="fig_4.1">
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Other ways of classifying retailers include</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">consumer purchasing behavior (convenience, shopping, specialty, or unsought);</li>
      <li class="bl">organizational format (for example, wholly owned or franchised);</li>
      <li class="bl">merchandise line(s) carried by the store (for example, specialty stores versus general-line
        stores);</li>
      <li class="bl">capital requirements in terms of displaying merchandise (stores selling perishables have equipment
        requirements not found in other retail settings); and</li>
      <li class="bl">human resource requirements in terms of expertise (for example, the staff of an automobile dealer
        needs knowledge about financing, registering, and licensing issues not relevant in other retail industries).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Systems of classification like these are important to retail marketers because different kinds of
      retailing require different marketing strategies. Decisions about market niche, location, and merchandise
      assortment, as well as branding and advertising promises, will all be based on the class in which a retailer fits.
      Each type of retail business will have specific requirements for its location, which brings us to the next
      strategic issue.</p>

    <a id="p118"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.2.2">Retail Location as Part of Place Strategy</h2>

    <p class="tx">The location a retailer chooses can make or break a business. The cost of a good retail location will
      be one of the business&#x2019;s highest expenses. A wholesaler or distributor can save money by locating where
      rents are cheap, but a retailer typically cannot.</p>

    <p class="tx">Bricks-and-mortar retailers require a location close to a sufficiently dense population center to
      provide a steady stream of customers. But not just any population will do. The demographics of the people around
      the location must present a good fit between the retailer and the chosen market niche. Traffic patterns in the
      area are a concern; something as basic as a difficult left turn can spoil a retail location. Time of day matters:
      A breakfast restaurant will want to locate on the right-hand side of the road that most people take to work.</p>

    <p class="tx">The physical building a retailer occupies becomes part of its brand image. A location in a shopping
      mall projects one kind of image. Locations on urban Main Streets or in revitalized warehouse districts present
      different images.</p>

    <p class="tx">A location decision is not just about where the store should be, but what types of retail activity are
      going on nearby. For decades, shopping malls have promoted the advantage of strong central management, combined
      marketing muscle, and typically a major retailer that attracts high traffic&#x2014;a benefit to smaller stores in
      the mall. A few retailers function as destinations in themselves, like Bass Pro and IKEA, by featuring tremendous
      breadth in the product assortment available, as well as restaurants and attractions that encourage shoppers to
      spend more time there. Downtowns, once the center of American retailing, offer some of the same advantages of a
      mall location if businesses cooperate on issues like parking and store hours. Old industrial areas often find new
      life when creative people repurpose them for artists&#x2019; studios, dance clubs, and the like, chiefly because
      of inexpensive rents. Each type of location&#x2014;mall, downtown, or industrial district&#x2014;conveys a
      specific impression, a branding decision that must be part of marketers&#x2019; location strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx">A final factor of retail location, in addition to market demographics, traffic patterns, complementary
      businesses, and brand image, is what goes on inside the store. Layout of the facility, from the display windows to
      the traffic flow to the way merchandise is displayed, must support the company&#x2019;s positioning and facilitate
      sales. The appearance of &quot;trend zones&quot; in CVS stores&#x2014;areas where &quot;better for you&quot; snack
      and beverage items are displayed together&#x2014;reflects the company&#x2019;s push for healthier food products
      since 2016. Within the trend zone, items are grouped by diet types, including vegan and organic. This
      reconfiguration is designed to respond to consumers&#x2019; interest in both convenience and health (Foland,
      2017). </p>

    <p class="tx">Because all these bricks-and-mortar location factors affect businesses&#x2019; ability to sell their
      wares to consumers, they are of concern to marketers and must be considered as part of the place strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx">The Brownstone Woman (<a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://www.thebrownstonewoman.com/">http://www.thebrownstonewoman.com/</a>) is a
      <strong>bricks-and-clicks</strong> business&#x2014;owner Princess Jenkins retails both online and in a store in
      Harlem, New York. Jenkins has built a local shopping destination with a national following by focusing on elegant
      women&#x2019;s wear for an older customer base (40&#x2013;75 years old, sizes 12&#x2013;20). Jenkins&#x2019;s
      choice to locate in Harlem reflects her inspiration to create a boutique of ethnically inspired fashions. &quot;I
      lived in Harlem many years but there were no places I could shop. I realized that Harlem would be an incredible
      place to start a retail business,&quot; said Jenkins (personal communication, January 5, 2011).</p>

    <a id="p119"></a>
    <p class="tx">Her boutique is situated on a typical urban Main Street block in one of Harlem&#x2019;s dense retail
      neighborhoods. The narrow storefront provides adequate but not abundant display space. Inside, Jenkins has created
      an upscale environment for display of clothing, accessories, cosmetics, and gifts. Outside, a courtyard garden
      provides space for customer events and fashion shows.</p>

    <p class="tx">Jenkins could choose to pay a higher rent and locate in a larger space or among more upscale,
      complementary stores. Jenkins has chosen instead a location that meets her strategic need to balance providing an
      appealing customer experience with control of cost. </p>

    <p class="tx">Jenkins also conducts business through an online store and a printed catalog that she mails twice a
      year. &quot;It&#x2019;s been a great vehicle for us&quot; (personal communication, January 5, 2011) Jenkins said,
      but she expressed surprise that people often mention viewing her products in the catalog or online when they come
      into the store to purchase.</p>

    <p class="tx">Like the Brownstone Woman, many retailers now blend a bricks-and-mortar strategy with an online
      strategy. For retailers, an online &quot;location&quot; functions like a storefront. Whether online or in a
      physical location, the retail &quot;place&quot; must attract traffic from the right demographic groups, project a
      consistent and appealing brand image, and be laid out in a way that makes it easy for shoppers to find what
      they&#x2019;re looking for and talk themselves into buying. </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.2.3">Retail Merchandise Assortment as Part of Place Strategy</h2>

    <p class="tx">Selection of the retail merchandise assortment is where the P of place connects to the marketing mix P
      of product, discussed in Chapter 3. Retailers decide which items (individual products) and lines (closely related
      products) will become part of the merchandise assortment in their stores or on their websites.</p>

    <p class="tx">If a business carries too much inventory at any one time, it has paid for more than it needs, raising
      operating costs. This is bad for the bottom line, but good for business&#x2014;customer satisfaction is the result
      when people find what they&#x2019;re looking for in stock. If a business cuts back on inventory, it enjoys lower
      costs but runs the risk of disappointed customers who find products unavailable. Balancing supply and demand is an
      important aspect of a retailer&#x2019;s merchandise strategy. Retailers must also manage shelf space allotment to
      maximize sales, juggling the number of facings (how many items are visible at one time) as well as vertical and
      horizontal placement on the shelves. In some industries (primarily groceries and chain stores), manufacturers pay
      <strong>slotting fees</strong> for placement of their product in a specific location on retailers&#x2019; shelves
      (for example, at eye level). The fees vary greatly, depending on the placement requested, market conditions,
      product, and manufacturer.</p>

    <p class="tx">Another part of that merchandise strategy relates to the company&#x2019;s brand image, a component of
      its promotion strategy (which illustrates the interdependent nature of the four Ps). The use of private label
      products can attract consumers&#x2019; attention and stimulate demand. Retailers who contract with manufacturers
      to offer their own private label product line gain an edge in differentiating their products from
      competitors&#x2019; products by extending consumers&#x2019; good feelings about the store&#x2019;s brand to the
      products on its shelves. Trader Joe&#x2019;s specialty grocery chain has made a core marketing strategy out of
      producing private label products&#x2014;such as the Candy Cane Joe Joe&#x2019;s discussed in Chapter
      3&#x2014;contracting for a large assortment of products that it can purchase cost-effectively and thus sell for
      much lower prices than comparable name brands. Private label products have helped Trader Joe&#x2019;s
      differentiate itself from other grocers in a similar price bracket (Sustainable Industries, 2010). What&#x2019;s
      on the shelves, and where, is as integral to place strategy as the location of the store itself.</p>

      <p class="photo-caption">When specialty superstores like Lowe&#x2019;s enter a market, smaller stores find it hard
        to compete with the giants&#x2019; inventory depth, breadth, and pricing.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.2.4">Retail Challenges and Opportunities</h2>

    <p class="tx">Retail is a challenging business model. Specialty superstores, nonstore alternatives, and
      intermediaries increasingly compete with traditional retailers.</p>

    <p class="tx">Specialty superstores like Best Buy and AutoZone, offering a vast inventory of a specialized product
      assortment, first challenged traditional retailers in the late 20th century with a &quot;buy it cheap and stack it
      deep&quot; strategy that traditional retailers found hard to compete with. When home center chains like
      Lowe&#x2019;s and Home Depot entered a market, smaller hardware stores found it difficult to compete on price
      (Sinderman, 1997).</p>

    <p class="tx">Then came the nonstore alternatives, competing with almost every product category found on
      bricks-and-mortar store shelves, disrupting the disruptor superstores. The bookselling industry experienced a
      drastic reorganization from nonstore competition in the early 2000s as the online retailer Amazon (which opened
      for business in 1995) drew sales away from bricks-and-mortar retailers. Independently owned bookstores were the
      first to feel the pain. A decade later, even the large chain booksellers were forced to find new ways to compete
      or face closure. But Amazon was still growing. In 1998 it expanded into CDs and DVDs; in 1999 into toys and
      electronics; and in 2000 it launched Amazon Marketplace, its third-party seller service, and whole consumer
      categories suddenly felt the earth shift (Quinn, 2015). In 2017 Amazon purchased upscale grocery chain Whole Foods
      Market, transforming itself into a hybrid business model with physical locations in hundreds of communities across
      the United States (Wingfield &amp; de la Merced, 2017). </p>

    <a id="p121"></a>
    <p class="tx">Wholesalers and distributors represent other nonstore alternatives that compete with retailers in the
      bricks-and-mortar world. When these companies sell direct to consumers, online or through mail order, retailers
      who had previously counted on performing that role are cut out of the picture.</p>

    <p class="tx">One way traditional retailers have responded to these challenges is through increasing use of
      technology. The right technology can give a retailer a competitive advantage, through better sales forecasts,
      inventory control, staffing, and improved communication with customers. An example? Retailers are now offering
      promotional discounts to customers in or near their stores through coupons sent to shoppers&#x2019; smartphones.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">For the &quot;mom and pop shops&quot; that were once the mainstay of American retailing, emphasizing
      their small size and personal touch has become a means of competitive differentiation. Many consumers still value
      face-to-face transactions and trust businesses with local roots for better support after the sale than impersonal
      megaretailers or nonstore alternatives. Many small retailers target a specialty niche to fill a customer need, as
      the Brownstone Woman boutique has done. By emphasizing trustworthiness, specialization, and the personal touch,
      bricks-and-mortar retailers can turn consumers&#x2019; longing for meaningful dialogue and engagement (Marketing
      3.0) into a competitive advantage.</p>

    <p class="tx">While these would seem puny weapons with which to fight the Goliaths, the death of retail has not yet
      been declared. The companies hurt worst have been those with no meaningful competitive differentiation, such as
      chain apparel stores. Retail spending overall has been growing, which in 2017 the National Retail Federation
      attributed to continued stock market strength and low unemployment (Wahba, 2017). </p>

    <p class="tx">The companies that have evolved with their customers are faring better, such as Best Buy, which has
      reinvented itself as a provider of expert advice and redesigned its retail floor to feature branded in-store
      kiosks offering Apple, Microsoft, and even Amazon consumer electronics, in a strategy borrowed from department
      stores (Roose, 2017). </p>

    <p class="tx">To succeed, retailers must constantly search for superior marketing mix strategies, tinkering with
      decisions about each of the four Ps&#x2014;product, place, price, and promotion. Absolutely key is maintaining a
      marketing orientation, with customers at the center of all marketing mix decisions. &quot;The way consumers spend
      has changed, perhaps irrevocably. And for stores that can&#x2019;t adapt, there&#x2019;s likely to be more pain
      ahead,&quot; writes <em>Forbes</em>&#x2019;s Phil Wahba (2017). </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.2.5">Other Retail Models</h2>

    <p class="tx">Some retailers generate sales without any kind of physical place for consumers to visit. In
      <strong>direct marketing</strong>, sellers bypass intermediaries (wholesale and retailers) to sell directly to end
      users. QVC, the direct marketer known for its television programs as well as its extensive online store, is one
      example.</p>

    <a id="p122"></a>
    <p class="tx">The factor that differentiates direct marketers from other types of retailers is the absence of
      face-to-face interaction in the buying exchange. Customers of direct marketers shop through an impersonal medium,
      such as television, catalog, or website, and complete their purchase transactions without interacting with
      salespeople. Direct marketers face some of the same place issues that bricks-and-mortar retailers do&#x2014;they
      must still choose a market niche, a location for their business headquarters and distribution centers, and a
      merchandise assortment&#x2014;but these issues take on a different dimension. Direct marketers don&#x2019;t depend
      on specific geographic area(s) to provide sufficient customers in their market niche. They can locate the business
      anywhere that&#x2019;s practical in terms of the logistics of receiving and delivering goods. Their merchandise
      assortment can be as small as one item or as broad as Amazon&#x2019;s.</p>

    <p class="tx">Many direct marketing companies combine the functions of the entire distribution channel into one
      business without the use of any intermediaries. Others choose to emphasize the distributors&#x2019; role of
      breaking bulk and assembling lots, buying from many manufacturers to offer a broad merchandise assortment.
      Consider Harry &amp; David, the mail-order company whose roots go back to its Oregon fruit orchards. The company
      has shifted over time from the no-intermediaries model, selling only the fruit it grew, to a broad line that
      includes chocolates, wine, baked goods, and giftware coming from many sources.</p>

    <p class="tx">Direct marketers&#x2019; success depends on their ability to generate sales through impersonal media.
      They do so by focusing on strategic marketing mix decisions around the P of promotions. In fact, the term
      <em>direct marketing</em> carries a second meaning&#x2014;it is a promotional technique that seeks direct action
      from recipients, with a focus on measurable results.</p>

    <p class="tx">A close cousin to direct marketing is <strong>multilevel marketing</strong>, also called network
      marketing or referral marketing. Home-sales businesses such as Tupperware, Avon, or Creative Memories are examples
      of multilevel marketers that sell through independent agents who contact potential buyers personally. These
      nonsalaried agents earn money through sales of their company&#x2019;s products and through recruiting other
      individuals and helping them get started selling the product line. Agents receive a portion of the income their
      recruits generate. Because of the tight relationship between sales agent and parent company, multilevel marketing
      has more in common with direct marketing than with physical or online retail establishments. Multilevel marketers
      and direct marketers get their goods from manufacturer to end user with few to no intermediaries and no retail
      location.</p>

    <p class="tx">The type of business model a retailer chooses&#x2014;physical or online stores, direct marketing, or
      multilevel marketing&#x2014;matters to marketers. As mentioned earlier, most marketing mix decisions reflect the
      classification into which a retailer fits.</p>

    <p class="tx">In conclusion, fundamental to all retail place decisions is the customer&#x2019;s perspective,
      specifically the customer segment targeted as part of marketing strategy. (Market segmentation and targeting are
      discussed in depth in Chapter 7.) The three strategic issues for retailers&#x2014;market niche, location, and
      merchandise assortment&#x2014;must be addressed with target customers&#x2019; needs foremost in mind. Classifying
      retail businesses by market niche and other attributes helps sellers select appropriate marketing strategies.</p>

    <p class="tx">Bricks-and-mortar stores must make physical location decisions, balancing cost and other factors
      against customers&#x2019; perceptions of the fit of location to brand image. All retailers, regardless of whether
      they are location based, a nonstore alternative, or a hybrid, must decide what items to make part of their product
      assortment and how they will be displayed to customers. </p>

    <a id="p123"></a>
    <p class="tx">Retail trends include the increasing blend of physical stores and nonstore alternatives, and the use
      of technology to create an <strong>omnichannel</strong> user experience, which offer seamless shopping no matter
      whether the consumer is considering a purchase online or in a store. But perhaps the most interesting retail
      experiment underway is a return to the century-old idea of the showroom, where shopping is done in person and the
      purchase transaction is completed in the store, but the purchase is delivered later. Showrooms combine a
      face-to-face experience (humanity-centric Marketing 3.0) with the economic advantage of efficiency in supply
      chains and logistics. Furniture and home goods stores were among the first to use a showroom approach. Joining
      them are sellers of branded fashion apparel and electronic devices&#x2014;goods that are highly differentiated
      and/or are new to the consumer and thus benefit from in-person sales support (Hodson, Perrigo, &amp; Hardman,
      2017).</p>

    <p class="tx">This twist on the place strategy imperative to &quot;get the right goods in the right quantity to the
      right place for the lowest possible cost without sacrificing customer service&quot; (White, 2003, p. 38) shows
      promise for retailers with sufficiently differentiated goods. </p>

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec4.3">4.3&#x2002;Intermediaries: The Distribution Channel</h1>

    <p class="tx">You learned earlier about the storage and transportation functions distributors provide&#x2014;their
      contribution to the logistics strategy of other companies. It&#x2019;s time to learn about the other services that
      businesses in the distribution channel provide.</p>

    <p class="tx">Between retailer and manufacturer are intermediaries that help their customers&#x2014;businesses up
      and down the distribution channel&#x2014;bring value to the final consumer.</p>

    <p class="tx">As we discussed earlier, intermediaries working together in a distribution channel constitute a supply
      chain&#x2014;a network of interdependent entities linked by their roles in serving the same customers. In that
      chain are vendors who supply raw materials, producers who convert materials into products, storage centers that
      warehouse and transport products to retailers, and retailers who display and sell products to end users.
      Manufacturers choose the type of intermediaries they need depending on their channel strategy.</p>

    <a id="p124"></a>
    <p class="tx">Other ways of looking at the supply chain include the concept of the distribution channel, with its
      emphasis on the flow of goods and services from source to consumer and the flow of payments from consumer to
      source, and the <strong>value chain</strong>, focusing on value-adding activities that convert inputs into
      outputs, contribute to an organization&#x2019;s bottom line, and help create competitive advantage.</p>

    <p class="tx">A value chain, supply chain, or distribution channel&#x2014;the term used depends on which aspect of
      the function is the focus of attention&#x2014;typically consists of a logistics system to source and deliver
      inputs, a manufacturing operation, outbound distribution, retail marketing and selling, and finally, after-sales
      service, including reverse logistics for merchandise returns. </p>

    <p class="tx">Many businesses use more than one distribution channel because their products or services are used in
      different ways by different niches of buyers. For example, Kellogg&#x2019;s breakfast cereals are packaged in
      boxes ranging from 12 ounces to 36 ounces for grocery store distribution, and in single-serving 0.75-ounce bowls
      for cafeteria feeding operations. (<a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://www.kelloggs.com/">http://www.kelloggs.com</a>). One supply chain carries raw materials from the
      farm field through the flake manufacturing process, but at the packaging plant it splits. Two different flows
      carry the packaged flakes through different distribution channels to their end users. </p>

      <p class="photo-caption">Wholesalers provide the service of breaking bulk and assembling smaller lots because
        manufacturers make a few products in large quantities, but consumers buy many products in small quantities.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.3.1">Breaking Bulk, Assembling Lots, and More</h2>

    <p class="tx">Intermediaries provide a solution to retailers who need goods available in the right quantity, at the
      right time, and in the right place, to serve their customers. In terms of the four utilities of customer value
      discussed in Chapter 1, intermediaries add value by delivering ease of possession. To serve retailers, they break
      bulk, assemble lots, provide financing, and/or assume risks of spoilage, storage, and uncertain demand.</p>

    <p class="tx">Manufacturers typically make limited assortments of products in large numbers (e.g., Procter &amp;
      Gamble factory making shampoos). But consumers demand broad assortments of products and brands, each in small
      quantities (e.g., groceries). This creates the need for <strong>wholesalers</strong> to buy in bulk from
      manufacturers and sell in smaller assortments to retailers or industrial buyers, thus providing the service of
      managing supply to meet demand.</p>

    <a id="p125"></a>
    <p class="tx">Additional functions of various intermediaries (channel partners) include the following. </p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Consulting: Providing services, including sales forecasts, market research, industry information,
        and advice.</li>
      <li class="bl">Marketing: Communicating persuasive messages to generate demand for items.</li>
      <li class="bl">Promoting: Using sales incentives, special pricing, and other techniques to stimulate greater
        demand.</li>
      <li class="bl">Logistics: Shipping and transport, warehousing, and inventory control.</li>
      <li class="bl">Materials handling: Packaging items for safe transport.</li>
      <li class="bl">Order processing: Creating systems to track the order by generating a pick list, packing slip, and
        invoice.</li>
      <li class="bl">Financing: Using funds to cover the costs of intermediary functions.</li>
      <li class="bl">Risk taking: Assuming the risk of intermediary functions (e.g., a fire in the warehouse).</li>
      <li class="bl">Support: Providing support when products are complex. </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">A channel strategy may include a mix of these functions, depending on the demands of different product
      lines. For example, a medical device manufacturer may sell its weight-loss products through a wholesaler to retail
      pharmacies but sell its physical therapy products through sales agents who can provide more support and training
      than a retail channel partner could.</p>

    <p class="tx">Intermediaries in the distribution channel create flows of information, of marketing messages, and of
      goods. There may also be multiple changes of ownership, with an accompanying flow of transaction
      records&#x2014;orders, invoices, account statements, and payments. All these intermediary functions are necessary.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Wholesale distributors make their income on the difference between the price of goods purchased and
      the price of goods sold. Sales agents make their income from the percentage points of a sales commission.
      Distributors&#x2019; customers pressure them to carry a full line, stocked deep enough to support immediate
      delivery when an order comes in. But purchasing inventory in advance of demand is expensive. Distributors&#x2019;
      customers also exert considerable pressure to keep prices low, affecting their price strategy. Distributors can
      look to other marketing mix factors like place and promotion strategies to break the deadlock between
      customers&#x2019; pressures to carry deep product inventory but keep prices low.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.3.2">Distribution Channel Strategy and Competitive Advantage</h2>

    <p class="tx">All businesses&#x2014;retailers, intermediaries, and manufacturers&#x2014;must commit to some form of
      distribution channel strategy. They either need the services distributors offer or they choose to provide those
      services as intermediary channel partners. Because relationships in the distribution channel tend to be long-term,
      each company&#x2019;s choice of channel partners will be a crucial factor in overall business strategy. In this
      way, too, place strategy has a significant impact on other aspects of the marketing mix.</p>

    <p class="tx">One strategic response is to organize a <strong>vertical market system</strong>&#x2014;a coordinated
      distribution channel in which channel partners commit to working together. A vertical market system can achieve
      greater efficiency and economies of scale and eliminate conflict arising from competing business objectives among
      the partners. Three common types of vertical market systems&#xA0;are</p>

    <a id="p126"></a>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"><em>administered:</em> the size and influence of a dominant firm leads to coordination in the
        distribution channel, without a formal agreement or ownership;</li>
      <li class="nl"><em>contractual:</em> independent channel partners formally agree to integrate their resources, as
        in the franchise business model; and</li>
      <li class="nl"><em>corporate:</em> a manufacturing firm owns and controls a retail chain (forward integration), or
        a retail chain owns a manufacturer firm (backward integration).</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">The number of channel partners in a company&#x2019;s distribution system affects cost and complexity
      of operations. So why would a business develop a channel strategy that involves many partners? To broaden its
      reach, serve more customers, and thus make more sales. However, increasing the number of businesses involved in
      the distribution channel creates more difficulty in controlling those businesses. The flow of information,
      promotional messages, goods, and transaction records becomes more complex. A fumble in any part of the flow can
      directly affect customer service. Also, as the number of relationships multiply, it becomes harder to keep prices
      low, since each strives to operate at a profit. Increasing complexity in the distribution channel makes both
      management and cost containment more challenging.</p>

    <p class="tx">These risks argue against complex distribution channel strategies. There will always be a need to make
      trade-offs between the mutually exclusive goals of customer service and cost containment. This is fundamental for
      marketers, since how the distribution channel functions affects a company&#x2019;s ability to compete.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider the example of Luke&#x2019;s Lobster restaurants. Luke Holden opened the first Luke&#x2019;s
      Lobster in New York&#x2019;s East Village in 2009, a Maine-style lobster shack that competes with a value
      proposition of serving sustainably sourced seafood and a strategy of vertical integration to make sure it could
      keep that promise by controlling its supply chain. By 2016 the business operated 19 Luke&#x2019;s Lobster
      restaurants and two food trucks and had expanded globally with five lobster shacks in Japan. The firm first bought
      into a co-op of Maine fishers, which made it possible to trace every pound of seafood to the harbor where it was
      caught and allowed greater control over quality and pricing. Then Holden purchased a seafood processing plant that
      is the main supplier for the restaurants, completing a vertical market system that reaches from ocean to table
      (Morrissey, 2016). </p>

    <p class="tx">Figure 4.2 demonstrates the dynamic relationship of distribution channel characteristics. The ideal
      (great value at low cost) can be difficult to achieve. Luke&#x2019;s Lobster is an example of a business that has
      achieved delivering great value (with its superior product) while controlling costs via its corporate vertical
      market system. </p>

    <a id="p127"></a>
    <div class="figure-box">
      <h4 class="figure-name">Figure 4.2: Distribution channel characteristics</h4>
      <h5 class="figure-title">The relationship between number of channel partners and cost of operations is directly
        proportional, making it difficult to keep customer service high and prices low as the distribution channel
        becomes more complex.</h5>
      <img src="figures/fig_4.2.jpg"
        alt="Graph that shows the direct relationship between cost and distribution channel."
        title="Graph that shows the direct relationship between cost and distribution channel." class="figure"
        id="fig_4.2">
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Every business strives to find a way to use its distribution strategy to add value. The company that
      succeeds in doing so will find itself able to compete on more than just price. </p>

    <p class="tx">Taking the idea of the vertical market system to its logical extreme leads to the <strong>direct
        channel system</strong>, in which a company distributes directly to the final customer or end user without the
      help of outside intermediaries. This is similar to the direct marketing retail model discussed earlier but with a
      distinct difference. Direct marketing is defined by its <em>sales approach</em>&#x2014;the lack of personal
      interaction between seller and buyers. The direct channel system is defined by its <em>business model</em>, in
      which each intermediary in the supply chain is owned by the parent company. (If a company owned all intermediaries
      AND sold through impersonal media, it would be a direct marketer using the direct channel system.) </p>

    <a id="p128"></a>
    <p class="tx">This approach allows greater control, as the example of Luke&#x2019;s Lobster shows, and may deliver
      cost savings through efficiency and the elimination of intermediaries&#x2019; markups. Advantages of the direct
      channel system include control of the marketing mix decisions and closer contact with customers. This strategy is
      particularly useful if suitable supply chain partners are not available, as can be the case with the introduction
      of a new product, where distributors may simply decline to take a chance on unproven customer demand. However, the
      company choosing a direct channel system must assume responsibility for producing the value added by supply chain
      partners (such as breaking bulk, assembling lots, and assuming risk, as discussed earlier). Where that is not
      feasible, using intermediaries is the better strategy. </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.3.3">Tracking Technology</h2>

    <p class="tx">As the UPS &quot;Logistics&quot; commercial in <em>Field Trip 4.1</em> emphasizes, tracking technology
      has become an integral part of physical distribution strategies and a potential source of competitive advantage.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">The UPC (Universal Product Code) bar code, developed by a grocery industry committee in 1973 bent on
      automating inventory control to cut labor costs, standardized the representation of consumer product information
      (Fox, 2011). Use of bar codes achieved the goal of cutting labor costs by reducing the time and effort needed to
      input tracking data manually. It also improved data accuracy. The technology soon spread to almost every aspect of
      modern life, from product distribution to airline luggage handling.</p>

    <p class="tx">Tracking technology took another step toward greater efficiency and cost control with the development
      of <strong>radio frequency identification (RFID)</strong> tags, which rely on a microchip to broadcast
      information. While bar codes require a person to manually scan a label to capture data, RFID enables devices to
      capture data from tags and send it to a computer system without any manual labor. At first, the cost of RFID
      technology slowed its adoption (Bragg, 2011). Usage of RFID technology spread where the cost could be justified,
      typically in situations in which the amount of product being moved is large enough to absorb the expense. By 2017
      major apparel retailers were the highest adopters of RFID because a clear case could be made for return on
      investment. &quot;Retailers can drive higher sales by making sure they have the right product on the shelf, in the
      correct size and color, and at the same time lower their inventory costs due to a more accurate supply chain&quot;
      (Zaino, 2017, para. 7), according to RFiD Journal. Manufacturing industries are also adopting RFID, where the
      technology enables greater control of manufacturing processes. The technology is at its most mature in the transit
      and banking sectors, where monitoring location and access are crucial business functions (Zaino,&#xA0;2017). </p>

    <p class="tx">A company&#x2019;s approach to logistics can create competitive differentiation. In the case of
      iMemories, a digital film transfer and hosting company, differentiation in the crowded field of film transfer
      services is achieved through promoting the use of RFID tracking technology. Customers for film transfer services
      must send their original home movies to a service for digitization, expecting to receive the end product on hard
      drive, DVD, or Blu-ray disks. However, the fear of losing the original movies in transit stops many customers from
      acting or drives them to a competitor offering a local pickup/delivery option. To compete, iMemories introduced a
      SafeShip Kit + GPS option. Customers order the kit, which arrives as a crush-proof box ready for packing with home
      movies, complete with shock-resistant padding and waterproof lining. Also included is a GPS tracking unit
      (essentially an RFID tag), which the customer activates before shipping. Customers can then log on to the
      iMemories website to see the location of their packages in real time.</p>

    <a id="p129"></a>
    <p class="tx">When iMemories ships a completed product back to the customer, along with the original home movies,
      the tracking unit is again activated. While technically not necessary&#x2014;the customer could use any shipping
      service offering tracking, such as FedEx or UPS, for the same purpose&#x2014;iMemories has created a value
      proposition that brands tracking technology as part of its superior service, thus standing out among competitors.
    </p>

      <p class="tx">Compare the websites of iMemories and YesVideo, focusing on their promises concerning sending your
        home movies to be transferred and receiving the finished product. While iMemories uses RFID tracking to

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.3.4">Distribution Channel Challenges and Opportunities</h2>

    <p class="tx">Doing business in a Marketing 3.0 world has several effects on distribution channel strategies.
      Advances in technology facilitate communication, making it easier to manage the complexity of multiple channel
      partners. As a result, more companies are finding it feasible to expand into more markets. Plus, the ability to
      conduct secure financial transactions online has enhanced the flow of transactional information. E-commerce and
      the Internet have had a profoundly positive impact on channel strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx">Decisions about distribution channels are among the most complex and challenging facing marketers.
      Once set, they are difficult to change&#x2014;and yet in the 21st century, business evolves rapidly and requires
      capacity for nimble response. Channel systems don&#x2019;t stand still. Like river channels, they&#x2019;re always
      under pressure to change due to influences around them&#x2014;both upstream and down.</p>

    <p class="tx">To summarize, intermediaries (channel partners) work together as a supply chain providing functions
      (supplying, converting, storing, transporting, marketing, selling, and servicing) within a distribution channel.
      Retailers benefit from intermediaries&#x2019; function of breaking bulk and assembling lots, so they can offer
      goods in the right quantity, at the right time, and in the right place. Businesses seek competitive advantages
      through distribution channel strategies such as vertical marketing systems, merchandise assortments, and tracking
      technology.</p>


    <a id="p130"></a>
    <p class="tx">Developing a distribution channel strategy is a significant challenge for marketers for three major
      reasons:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">the sheer number of intermediaries that may be involved,</li>
      <li class="nl">the difficulty of assembling channel partners who extend a company&#x2019;s reach without
        increasing the complexity of managing them to an unsustainable degree, and</li>
      <li class="nl">the need for a reasonably flexible channel strategy that adds value but constrains&#xA0;costs.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">Channel design requires keeping the demand chain in mind&#x2014;what do consumers need? It requires
      assessing distribution channel needs and identifying alternatives: Few or many intermediaries? In what roles? With
      what responsibilities? And finally, channel design requires evaluating alternatives to choose a strategy that can
      deliver value and adapt to changing conditions.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Technology that facilitates communications and financial transactions has a positive impact on a
        company&#x2019;s distribution channel strategy. However, Marketing 3.0 tells us that the same technology that
        helps one company also reduces barriers to entry for competitors who may challenge that company. Think about
        Internet applications for distribution channel management. How might technology assist the functions of
        inventory management, consulting, marketing, promotions, logistics, order processing, and financing? Pick one
        to&#xA0;discuss.</p>

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec4.4">4.4&#x2002;Manufacturing: Where the Goods Originate</h1>

    <div class="photo-right">

      <p class="credit">Jupiterimages/Creatas/Getty Images Plus</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">For manufacturers, issues of place concern delivery of the products and services needed
        to make products and the services necessary to get products to market.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">No retailer would exist, nor any intermediary, without manufacturers to produce the stuff that flows
      down the distribution channel toward consumers. In the industrial parks where manufacturers operate, a vast range
      of activity is taking place&#x2014;not just making the goods that consumers buy but also making the machines and
      process materials required to make the goods that go downstream to consumers. For every can of dog food that
      appears in a pet supply retailer&#x2019;s merchandise assortment, there&#x2019;s a group of companies providing
      goods and services to the dog food manufacturer. One company manufactures canning supplies, another sells meat
      by-products, another sells industrial food processing installations, and another provides the printed labels to
      apply to the cans. All that happens before the dog food gets shrink-wrapped onto pallets (requiring two or three
      more suppliers) and hits the truck that carries the product to the retailers.</p>

    <a id="p131"></a>
    <p class="tx">All that activity means that manufacturers face logistics issues, just as retailers and intermediaries
      do. For manufacturers, these issues center around the services required to take delivery of the products and
      services necessary for their industrial processes, as well as the services necessary to get goods from the factory
      floor to the end user&#x2019;s door.</p>

    <p class="tx">Place strategy also puts manufacturers face-to-face with the P of product strategy (discussed in
      Chapter 3) in that the demand for the products they manufacture flows from retailers&#x2019; strategic decisions
      about their merchandise assortments&#x2014;another example of the interdependence of the elements of the marketing
      mix. Manufacturers must either promote their output to channel partners or create relationships that guarantee
      buyers for what they sell.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.4.1">Private Label Strategy Boosts Profit Margins</h2>

    <p class="tx">Private label products, also known as <strong>house brands</strong>, represent a relationship between
      manufacturers and retailers that increases profit margins for the retailer. Private label products that are
      comparable in features and quality to recognized name brands can reduce the cost to retailers by 40% to 50%
      (Hariharan, 2016). </p>

    <p class="tx">As private label products have improved in terms of their product quality and packaging, consumer
      acceptance has increased. This trend has been positive for retailers who contract with manufacturers for their own
      house brands.</p>

    <p class="tx">Most manufacturers, except for direct marketers, sell to channel partners&#x2014;the intermediary
      businesses they&#x2019;ve selected to be part of their distribution channel, as discussed earlier. Channel
      partners take ownership from manufacturers, add value through shipping and warehousing, and then sell to other
      channel partners or to the retailers at the mouth of the channel.</p>

    <p class="tx">But in the case of private labeling, manufacturers sell directly to retailers, who have contracted for
      specific products to be manufactured for sale under their own store brands. Several benefits accrue for the
      manufacturer, besides increased profit margin, including reduced costs and increased stability.</p>

    <p class="tx">Costs are reduced because the distribution channel becomes shorter and more straightforward; the
      contractual relationship between manufacturer and retailer reduces or eliminates channel partners to buy, sell, or
      add value through other services. The primary distribution issue is the physical logistics of moving goods from
      the point of production to the point of sale. Manufacturers gain a steady customer base that can be more
      profitable than relying on wholesale distribution, even with the lower price paid by the retailer taken into
      account.</p>

    <p class="tx">There is some cause for concern that stores&#x2019; private label brands are a competitive threat to
      manufacturers&#x2019; brands, since many consumers perceive private label products to be a better&#xA0;value.</p>

    <p class="tx">On the surface, manufacturing private label products on contract and producing manufacturer brand
      products put the producer in a position of conflict of interest. However, manufacturers who participate in private
      label supply chains are finding the relationship mutually beneficial. Most manufacturers have been able to
      separate how they manage their branded products from any private label products they produce well enough to avoid
      the potential for competitive threat or conflict of interest. Private label products increased in popularity
      during the economic downturn of 2007&#x2013;2009. &quot;Consumers have come to feel less like they are
      &#x2018;sacrificing&#x2019; quality for lower prices,&quot; says Ken Sawka (2011, para. 3), managing partner for
      Outward Insights, a competitive intelligence firm.</p>

    <a id="p132"></a>
    <p class="tx">Industry analysts expect continued growth in the use of private label strategies. The industry surged
      during the recession of 2007&#x2013;2009, as consumers sought the bargains private label products offered. That
      growth plateaued in 2014&#x2013;2015 and then ticked upward again as house brands began to appear in more premium
      and specialty categories, in response to consumer demand. Millennials, whose purchase patterns tend to be
      &quot;brand agnostic,&quot; are expected to drive future growth in the demand for private label products (Blair,
      2016). </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.4.2">Push or Pull? Strategy Affects Promotion</h2>

    <p class="tx">Manufacturers&#x2019; place strategy affects their promotional strategy decisions, more evidence of
      the interdependence of the four Ps of the marketing mix. To get products flowing down the distribution channel,
      manufacturers must make a choice whether to concentrate on convincing channel partners to buy their goods or to
      focus on reaching potential consumers and persuading them to create demand for the goods by asking channel
      partners for them.</p>

    <p class="tx">In a &quot;push&quot; strategy, manufacturers offer incentives that encourage intermediaries to carry
      the products. These can range from volume discounts to sales rewards like travel packages. Incentives can increase
      profits for both retailers and manufacturers. In a &quot;pull&quot; strategy, manufacturers use communication
      channels ranging from mass-market advertising to social media to reach end consumers with messages about features
      and benefits of the product for sale. Once consumer demand has been stimulated&#x2014;individuals are requesting
      that retailers stock the advertised goods&#x2014;demand flows up the channel to the manufacturer. Manufacturers
      with sufficient budgets for promotion may combine the strategies, designing promotions for both channel partners
      and consumers.</p>

    <p class="tx">For an example of push versus pull, look no further than the nearest television or glossy magazine,
      where drug manufacturers advertise to potential consumers, hoping to persuade them of the benefits of various
      medicines and stimulate them to ask their doctors about them&#x2014;a pull strategy. At the same time, but less
      visible to the consumer, drug manufacturers address marketing strategies directly to doctors, hoping to convince
      them to prescribe their products&#x2014;a push strategy.</p>

      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 4.5: </strong><em>Direct-to-Consumer Drug Ads</em></h1>
      <p class="tx">Pull advertising by drug manufacturers, legal since 1985, took off in 1997 when the U.S. Food and
        Drug Administration eased its rules about listing side effects. In 2015 the American Medical Association began
        calling for a ban on these ads, citing concerns that they were driving demand for expensive treatments despite
        the existence of effective, lower cost alternatives. This issue could be an example of Marketing 3.0&#x2019;s
        view of customers as collaborative partners in their medical treatment decisions. Read pros and cons of the
        argument in the article &quot;Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?&quot;</p>

      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Opting for a private label relationship transfers the responsibility for promotions from the
      manufacturer to the retailer, making push or pull strategies irrelevant.</p>

    <p class="tx">The goal of place strategy is, at its most fundamental, to balance customer service with
      cost&#x2014;to find the greatest efficiency in physical logistics and channel partner relationships without
      sacrificing customer service, thereby doing damage to the customer value equation. As has been shown, two place
      concerns affect manufacturers&#x2014;physical logistics and distribution channel relationships that either
      guarantee a buyer or require a promotional strategy to create demand.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">The manufacturer is considered the beginning of the distribution channel. But B2B companies produce
        goods and services that are sold to manufacturers. Where does the distribution channel really begin? Describe a
        distribution channel from the point of view of a baked goods manufacturer and from the perspective of a flour
        manufacturer.</p>
      <p class="tx">What marketing strategy would make sense for either the bakery or the flour manufacturer&#x2014;a
        private label production contract, a push strategy, or a pull strategy?</p>

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec4.5">4.5&#x2002;Place Strategy: A Global Approach</h1>

    <p class="tx">It is now more feasible than ever to do business across national borders. Two aspects of Marketing 3.0
      make this so: Consumers&#x2019; demand for meaningful engagement does not stop at borders, nor does
      technology&#x2019;s ability to reduce barriers and expand reach.</p>

    <p class="tx">Taking advantage of international markets for a company&#x2019;s offerings can be good for business in
      many ways. For example, a company can extend its customer base, counter market saturation in the home country, or
      minimize the effect of home-market economic downturns by focusing on growth in other markets with more promising
      economic climates. Having overseas operations can also increase the intrinsic value of the business, which could
      make good strategic sense (Grant Thornton UK, 2015).</p>

    <a id="p134"></a>
    <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s look at how global place strategies affect a business&#x2019;s ability to achieve the
      goals of place: getting the right goods, in the right quantity, to the right place, for the lowest possible cost
      without sacrificing customer service. Doing business across borders can mean exporting products and services,
      importing them, or a mix of both. Joint ventures and direct investment offer additional ways a firm can have an
      international presence. Each brings with it supply chain and logistics considerations. A closer look at these ways
      to enter global markets follows. But first, let&#x2019;s review the components of place strategy through the lens
      of multinational business. </p>

    <p class="tx">We began our examination of global place with logistics&#x2014;the physical flow of goods from
      manufacturers through distributors to customers, either through bricks-and-mortar retailers or nonstore
      alternatives. </p>

    <p class="tx">The more complex the supply chain, the more vulnerable the businesses in it become. A business model
      that wraps around the world is by its nature complex and vulnerable. Each country will have its own physical
      distribution system, and it may be difficult for global marketers to adapt their channel strategy from the home
      market to work in each new country. In developed countries, those systems may be hard to penetrate, due to
      existing business relationships and cultural differences. In some developing countries, distribution systems may
      be weak, inefficient, or nonexistent (while in others, they may be highly developed but unfamiliar compared to
      that in the home country). Designing a distribution channel strategy that works across borders can be challenging.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Swedish furniture giant IKEA entered the U.S. market in 1985 and began retail operations in China in
      1998. Each new country/market required adaptation if its strategies. In the United States the company discovered
      that it needed to customize products&#x2014;American consumers demanded bigger beds, which affected the supply
      chain all the way to the manufacturing source. China required smaller products, reflecting smaller apartment
      sizes. IKEA responded with slight modifications to its furniture and store layouts that reflected the typical
      sizes of apartments (Chu, Girdhar,&#xA0;&amp; Sood, 2013). </p>

    <p class="tx">Day in and day out, the flow of goods adapts to hiccups and setbacks, from flooding of the Mississippi
      that halts interstate trucking, to volcanic eruptions that ground air travel, to disasters like the hurricane that
      flooded Houston in 2017, disrupting the routes of tankers bringing oil, gasoline, and other products, as well as
      container ships bearing products both into and out of the area&#x2019;s ports (Phillips &amp; Baskin, 2017). What
      keeps marketers committed to global place strategies, in spite of the challenges of adapting to new markets and
      maintaining complex supply chains? The potential to reach less saturated markets and increase profits.</p>

    <p class="tx">Retailing in global markets can call for a strategy that Sylvia Vorhauser-Smith (2002) has named
      &quot;going glocal&quot;&#x2014;adapting to local tastes, consumer attitudes, and values. Given what we understand
      about consumers&#x2019; increasing interest in cocreation and personalization, it makes sense that retailing far
      from a company&#x2019;s home market would require adapting products&#x2014;Starbucks offering Cinnamon Horchata
      Frappuccino in Mexico, for example. Location decisions should reflect retailing strategies in the target country
      and region: Do customers typically shop in downtowns, suburbs, or shopping malls? </p>

    <a id="p135"></a>
    <p class="tx">Manufacturing may call for a variety of &quot;glocalization&quot; strategies as well, such as 3-D
      printing or private labeling of goods produced near the point of sale. </p>

    <p class="tx">Strategic decisions about merchandise mix and use of intermediary channel partners will reflect how a
      firm plans to do business across borders, including the following aspects.</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">exporting</li>
      <li class="bl">importing</li>
      <li class="bl">international joint ventures</li>

      <li class="bl">licensing</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s take a closer look at each.</p>

      <p class="photo-caption">Global markets offer new opportunities. A successful U.S. company can become a global
        company by exporting its existing business model.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.5.1">Exporting</h2>

    <p class="tx">Retailers with deep pockets can expand into new markets to escape intense competition in the home
      market. Intermediaries can grow their business by providing retailers with the distribution channel solutions
      needed to establish themselves in new markets. Manufacturers can increase overall production by developing or
      adapting products for the needs of new customer groups in other countries.</p>

    <p class="tx">Businesses are seeing opportunity everywhere the middle class is expanding, including countries in
      Europe, Asia, and South America. Starbucks realigned its top management in 2011 to prepare for a corporate growth
      strategy calling for greater presence worldwide. At the time, Starbucks, based in Seattle, had nearly 11,000
      stores in North America and 6,000 elsewhere. According to founder Howard Schultz, the company intended to focus on
      opportunities in markets in countries such as China, Brazil, and India (Associated Press, 2011). The strategy is
      working: For example, in China alone, by year-end 2015 Starbucks had 1,811 stores (counting both company-operated
      and licensed stores), compared with 496 stores in 2011. The number worldwide had reached 23,043 (Statista, 2016).
      In January 2016 <em>Forbes</em>reported that </p>

    <p class="ext">[Starbucks] believes that China represents its most important and exciting opportunity with the
      potential of becoming its largest market. . . . Since its launch in China, Starbucks has ensured that it adapts
      itself to the local environment and this strategy has been instrumental to its growth in the region. (paras.
      1&#x2013;2)</p>

    <a id="p136"></a>
    <p class="tx">Exporting a business model that brought success in the United States is one option to create a global
      company, as Starbucks did taking its cafes stocked with private label consumer products into new markets.
      Starbucks and other U.S. brands like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald&#x2019;s have succeeded in China by
      introducing and selling their American-style products, counting on the Chinese to develop a taste for
      &quot;exotic&quot; fare such as coffee, hamburgers, and fried chicken. But purchasing a company in the target
      country is another global business model. Nestl&#xE9;, the Swiss food-products giant, purchased the Chinese
      manufacturer Hsu Fu Chi International, a maker of popular candy, chocolate, and pastries, to give it greater
      presence in China (Wassener, 2011). General Mills achieved a successful global acquisition and merger with its
      purchase of the dominant supplier of dumplings in China&#x2014;Wanzai Matou. Dumplings are a staple of the Chinese
      diet, eaten at any time of day, at home and away. General Mills quietly gained control of Wanzai Matou in 2001
      when it acquired its U.S. rival Pillsbury&#xA0;from the British company Diageo. (In 1997 Pillsbury had purchased a
      majority stake in the dumpling maker.) General Mills foresaw that fewer Chinese would find time to make dumplings
      at home, something that had once been a time-consuming daily chore. Not only did General Mills gain an estimated
      50% share of the existing frozen dumpling market in China, it gained access to a growing market as more Chinese
      became willing to switch to the supermarket frozen version of the traditional dumplings (Fuhrman, 2014).</p>

    <p class="tx">Access to new, less saturated markets is an attractive proposition, as these examples show. However,
      global distribution channels can be difficult to negotiate. Global marketers must navigate carefully to maximize
      opportunities and reduce risk from difficult-to-foresee threats.</p>

    <div class="box-2">
      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 4.6: </strong><em>Expanding Middle Class</em></h1>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.5.2">Importing</h2>

    <p class="tx">Just as retailers, distributors, and manufacturers can find opportunity by targeting new markets, they
      can also find new profits by bringing new products to the home market. And while entering new markets beyond U.S.
      borders typically requires deep pockets, importing offers potential for smaller entrepreneurs. Thousands of
      relatively small import businesses emerge from Marketing 3.0&#x2013;style expectations for meaningful engagement,
      connecting producers and consumers in a business model known as <strong>Fair Trade</strong>. Fair Trade businesses
      in the United States import products from developing countries, offering assurance of fair trading conditions and
      higher environmental and social standards for producers as part of their customer value equation.</p>

    <a id="p137"></a>
    <p class="tx">Bali &amp; Soul (<a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="https://www.facebook.com/balisoulartistry/info/">https://www.facebook.com/balisoulartistry/info</a>), a
      Wisconsin-based distributor of indigenous crafts from Bali and other developing countries, presents an example of
      a Fair Trade importer on a small-business scale. The company was founded by a couple with family ties in both
      Indonesia and the Midwest. The company&#x2019;s first product line offered their relatives&#x2019; traditional
      woodcarvings from Bali to retailers in the United States. As the company grew, it expanded into jewelry,
      metalwork, basketry, fabrics, and art objects sourced from artisans in Ghana, India, and beyond. The business
      model of Bali &amp; Soul is to break bulk, assemble lots, and provide other services while making money on the
      margin between the wholesale purchase price and the retail sale price. What makes it Fair Trade is the
      founders&#x2019; commitment to sustainable development, better trading conditions, and high standards both where
      the goods originate and where they are sold.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.5.3">International Joint Ventures</h2>

    <p class="tx">When two or more businesses pool their resources to work together toward a common aim, a <strong>joint
        venture</strong> is born. Joint ventures are similar to business partnerships but are typically formed for a
      defined purpose or specific project, within a specified scope and duration. A joint venture usually requires a big
      commitment and a joint plan from both partners. At the start of any joint venture, all the partners involved
      negotiate what each will contribute and how the risk and reward will be shared. The contributions of each partner
      differ and tend to be based on the capabilities each brings to the table (Stewart &amp; Maughn, 2011). </p>

    <p class="tx">An international joint venture can reduce the investment required and speed the timetable for
      achieving operations in foreign markets, compared to alternatives like purchasing an existing company in the
      target country or investing directly in a new venture there.</p>

    <p class="tx">In 2012 the Kellogg Company entered into a joint venture with Singapore-based Wilmar International
      Limited for the manufacture, sale, and distribution of cereal and snacks in China. Wilmar contributed its
      infrastructure, supply chain scale, sales and distribution network in China, and local market expertise. The
      Kellogg Company (2012) brought its portfolio of globally recognized brands and deep cereal and snacks category
      expertise to the table. The venture has proven successful: In its 2014 annual report, Wilmar International Limited
      (2015)&#xA0;stated:</p>

    <p class="ext">The Group&#x2019;s joint venture with Kellogg Company in China formed in 2012 has made good progress
      as Kellogg&#x2019;s premium breakfast cereals and snacks gain popularity. Taking the partnership to the next
      level, another 50:50 joint venture was established in Kunshan to produce breakfast cereals and snacks.
      (p.&#xA0;13) </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.5.4">Direct Investment</h2>

    <p class="tx">Companies can tap global markets and reap the benefits of a global approach by foreign direct
      investment, in which a company invests in business interests in another country, either by setting up a subsidiary
      in the target country, acquiring or merging with an overseas company, or through a joint venture as described
      earlier. A company may choose direct foreign investment with the intent to produce components abroad that become
      part of its core offerings, such as an automaker building transmissions in one country that are shipped for final
      assembly by a plant in another country. Or a firm may choose to invest in a foreign market by duplicating the
      business model it employs in the home market, in order to supply its offerings to the foreign market. Paris-based
      Danone&#x2019;s purchase of YoCrunch, a U.S.-based yogurt topping company, is an example of direct foreign
      investment (Cruz, 2013). Setting up operations in this way can allow a company to avoid tariffs or other barriers
      to imports. Access to natural resources or low labor costs can influence the decision. Access to a pool of skilled
      employees and/or technology can also drive direct foreign investment, especially between equally advanced
      economies (Galeza &amp; Chan, 2015).</p>

    <a id="p138"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.5.5">Licensing</h2>

    <p class="tx">A potentially profitable business model for importers or exporters involves negotiating
      <strong>licensing</strong> arrangements that create a passive income stream. In this model, a business arranges
      for exclusive rights to market a product in a specific territory and then establishes trade relationships with
      channel partners, including manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. One licensing contract can result in
      ongoing profits for years, requiring little more than nurturing those partner relationships that keep the
      distribution channel flowing smoothly. Licensing functions well across borders, allowing U.S.-based firms to bring
      goods from around the world to their home market or take their products to new markets abroad. Either
      way&#x2014;inbound or outbound licensing&#x2014;this strategy gives firms new products without investing resources
      in a full global distribution channel strategy.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec4.5.6">Changing Business Models</h2>

    <p class="tx">Around the world, economies and individuals have become more interconnected, as is reflected by the
      rapid growth of social media networks. New forms of doing business across borders are emerging. What kind of
      global company is Airbnb, with its 60+ million guests around the world connecting with hosts via an app? The
      company is headquartered in San Francisco. In early 2018 it boasted over 3 million listings in 65,000 cities in
      191 countries (Airbnb, 2018).</p>

    <p class="tx">Airbnb is an example of a <strong>sharing economy</strong> business that takes advantage of the
      network effect (introduced in Chapter 3). A unique challenge of sharing economy businesses is the need to grow
      both suppliers and consumers of the service simultaneously (because each provides value to the other).
      Airbnb&#x2019;s growth product manager, Rebecca Rosenfelt, gave a talk entitled &quot;Going for Global&quot; in
      August 2014 in which she summed up this problem: Part of Airbnb&#x2019;s struggle to grow stems from its need to
      expand both the demand side (travelers) and the supply side (hosts) in every new market it attempts to enter.
      Airbnb discovered the supply side can be harder to establish, because getting people comfortable with the idea of
      opening their homes to strangers was a hurdle (Hook, 2016). The sharing economy&#x2019;s two-sided marketplace
      demonstrates the network effect in action, since the amount of value available to exchange depends on the number
      of participants on each side. </p>

    <a id="p139"></a>
    <p class="tx">Airbnb and another sharing economy company&#x2014;Uber&#x2014;have encountered difficulty with local
      regulations, from local tax structure and restrictions on short-term apartment rentals in Airbnb&#x2019;s case to
      taxi licensing and labor regulations in Uber&#x2019;s (Hook, 2016). Some communities have opted to prevent Uber or
      Airbnb from operating. These sharing economy companies are writing a disruptive new chapter in global business
      models.</p>

    <p class="tx">To successfully market goods and services on a global scale requires meticulous planning. Above all,
      it is important to remember that as experienced by the consumer, all markets are local. &quot;The key to success
      is a tremendous amount of local passion for the brand and a feeling of local pride and ownership,&quot; writes
      Gurcharan Das (2008, para. 7) in <em>Local Memoirs of a </em><em>Global Manager</em>.</p>

    <p class="tx">As stated earlier, there is growing consumer spending power wherever the middle class is expanding
      around the globe, creating potential for manufacturers, intermediaries, and retailers who are willing to do
      business across borders.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">The examples in this section lean toward the experiences of large companies. Do you believe
        opportunity exists for smaller business to follow a global approach profitably? Give an example of a small or
        medium-sized business you have recently purchased from that has a global strategy.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Each year, two teams face off to compete for the title of National Football League (NFL) champion at
      the Super Bowl. Across the nation, distribution channel partners for fan merchandise stand at the ready, knowing
      that a tidal wave of consumer demand will soon erupt for T-shirts from the winning team. But which team will win?
    </p>

    <p class="tx">The distribution of imprintable activewear&#x2014;that&#x2019;s T-shirts and sweats&#x2014;requires
      getting the right goods to the right place at the right time in a business where demand changes daily with the
      fortunes of sports teams. The channel partners who can do so while controlling costs will deliver customer value
      successfully. Millions of dollars are in play along the distribution channel that flows from manufacturers like
      North Carolina&#x2019;s Pluma to retailers who sell to sports teams&#x2019; fans.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider the supply chain for T-shirts destined for sale after the Super Bowl, where merchandising and
      licensing revenue is estimated to be a $1 billion business (Schrotenboer, 2014). Manufacturers like Pluma buy
      unprocessed cotton grown in Texas and apply manufacturing processes (spinning, knitting, cutting, stitching, and
      dyeing) until T-shirts come off the assembly line. Those shirts are purchased in bulk by wholesalers who provide
      the services (chiefly breaking bulk and assembling lots by size and color) that match supply with demand.</p>

    <p class="tx">Other channel partners buy the T-shirts from the wholesalers. An imprint operation takes delivery,
      counting on raking in sales to retailers who, on the day of a big game, measure every minute between the win and
      receiving the goods in hundreds of dollars of lost sales. For the Super Bowl, the imprint shop invests in
      inventory of shirts in both the competing teams&#x2019; colors. Until the early 1990s the imprinters dealt with
      the uncertain outcome of the big game by having workers standing by to silkscreen one or the other set of colored
      shirts with the winning team&#x2019;s graphics the moment the big game ended. Wholesalers stood ready, deeply
      stocked with shirts of both colors, knowing that imprinters would soon be placing orders to augment their supply
      of one or the other. But consumer demand for immediate access to the winning team&#x2019;s gear increasingly put
      pressure on that system. All up and down the supply chain, businesses strategized how to maximize the
      time-sensitive sales opportunity while minimizing the risks involved. Their answer, driven by the potential
      profits hanging on that insatiable consumer demand: The imprinters began producing two sets of T-shirts, hats, and
      other merchandise, declaring each of the two teams that year&#x2019;s Super Bowl champion. Each year, apparel for
      the winning team is quickly released for sale, while the losing team&#x2019;s merchandise is locked away, destined
      for donation to charities that will distribute the items in developing countries. Despite the obvious waste in
      creating merchandise for two teams when only one can win, the strategy succeeded in filling the distribution
      channel with the right goods at the right time in the right place, for the right price.</p>

    <a id="p140"></a>
    <p class="tx">For nearly 2 decades, the international humanitarian aid group World Vision collected the unwanted
      items from retailers and manufacturers licensed by the NFL to produce Super Bowl merchandise. In 2015 Good360 took
      over the relationship with the NFL (Soniak, 2018). </p>

    <p class="tx">As this example shows, the demand chain from consumers of imprintable activewear drove the industry to
      an unusual distribution channel strategy that relied not just on supplying what consumers wanted but on finding a
      suitable use for the waste by-products of that demand.</p>

    <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s review this chapter&#x2019;s main points from the perspective of channel partners in this
      T-shirt distribution channel. The retailer targets the market niche of fans. The community in which they are
      located dictates which teams local fans follow; the merchandise assortment will need to reflect the sport teams
      that have recently won. This retailer needs a distribution channel strategy capable of extreme flexibility,
      delivering the colors needed within hours of the wins. Upstream, T-shirt manufacturers&#x2019; physical logistics
      must be up to the task of moving shirts around the United States from point of manufacture to point of sale.
      Manufacturers in the activewear industry use private label contracts with some brands. Pluma, for example,
      produces shirts for major branded sports companies like Adidas, Nike, and Starter. Others are sold under the Pluma
      brand name. To promote their brands, manufacturers typically use push promotional strategies. There is little need
      to use a pull strategy, since there is plenty of consumer demand without it.</p>

      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Challenge Question</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">What have you purchased recently? Describe the distribution channel that brought that object to the
        retailer where you purchased it (at a store, online, or through a direct marketer or nonstore retailer). Use
        common sense to trace it back to its manufacturer&#x2014;and even to the raw materials. Now identify
        alternatives to this distribution channel that could potentially add value without increasing cost.</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">The goal of place strategy in terms of the customer value equation is to add value without
        increasing cost.</li>
      <li class="bl">Retailers face three strategic issues that affect place strategy: target market niche, location,
        and merchandise assortment.</li>
      <li class="bl">Developing a distribution channel strategy is a significant challenge for marketers for three major
        reasons: the number of intermediaries that may be involved, the difficulty of assembling channel partners who
        extend a company&#x2019;s reach without increasing the complexity of managing them to an unsustainable degree,
        and the need for a channel strategy that adds value.</li>
      <li class="bl">Manufacturers deal with two concerns: physical logistics and distribution channel relationships
        that either guarantee demand or require promotion to stimulate it.</li>
      <li class="bl">Marketers are motivated to pursue global place strategies by the potential to reach less saturated
        markets and increase bottom-line profits, in spite of the challenge of adapting to new markets and maintaining
        complex supply chains.</li>
      <li class="bl">Manufacturers can do business across national borders via exporting, importing, international joint
        ventures, direct investment, or licensing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="h1" id="ch05intro">Introduction</h1>


    <p class="tx">Musical icon Bruce Springsteen brought his talents to Broadway in 2017, choosing a theater with fewer
      than 1,000 seats for an event that combined storytelling with an intimate one-man performance featuring the Boss
      on piano and guitar. Springsteen set the ticket prices at $75 to $850; tickets were distributed through a lottery
      that required identity verification, with the intent to keep them from being resold by scalpers. But tickets
      leaked into the open market and could be found on StubHub at prices ranging from $1,200 to $9,999, the <em>New
        York Times</em> reported. With limited seating and apparently limitless demand, why would the Boss have chosen
      to price the tickets so much lower than fans were clearly willing to pay? We can&apos;t peer inside his head or
      heart to know, but <em>New York Times</em> journalist Neil Irwin offered, &quot;One view of the Springsteen
      approach is that it is economically irrational. But another is that it is part of a long-term relationship between
      a performer and his fans&quot; (Irwin, 2017, para. 8). Besides a rare theatrical experience, Springsteen has given
      us a view into the complex world of pricing strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx">Price plays two important roles in the marketing mix&#x2014;it influences how much of an offering will
      sell and how much profit the sale will generate for the seller. There&apos;s seldom a good reason for pricing an
      offering so low that it does not cover its costs (unless, like Bruce Springsteen, you have other motivations than
      profit). On the other hand, there&apos;s no point in pricing an offering so high that no one will buy. Between
      those two boundaries lies every company&apos;s pricing strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx">&quot;Price&quot; is a quantifiable way of measuring the value customers place on an offering.
      Marketers must understand the relationship of price to value, as value reflects&#x2014;and affects&#x2014;the
      brand image of the offering and the company selling it. This chapter examines the decision process that marketers
      go through in setting prices, while familiarizing you with the terminology marketers use. You will learn about
      strategies and tactics that apply to pricing, and about the challenges that make determining a pricing strategy
      for an organization&apos;s goods and services so complex. By the conclusion of this chapter, you will recognize
      how Marketing 3.0&apos;s call for more humanity-centric marketing practices influences this P of the marketing
      mix.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec5.1">5.1&#x2002;Pricing Basics</h1>

    <p class="tx">What <em>is</em> a price, exactly? The AMA (2017b) defines <strong>price</strong> as &quot;the formal
      ratio that indicates the quantities of money, goods, or services needed to acquire a given quantity of goods or
      services&quot; (para. 219). At its simplest, price might be described as what a customer has to give up in order
      to get what he or she wants to buy. That customer&apos;s sacrifice might consist of money, time, and/or effort.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Developing a pricing strategy is a requirement for every single business that brings an offering to
      market. (A note about terms: <em>offering</em> is used throughout this chapter when the unit for sale may be
      either a product or service. Since most of the principles of pricing apply equally to goods and services, the use
      of <em>offering</em> prevents unnecessary wordiness.)</p>

    <p class="tx">The right pricing strategy can lift a brand&apos;s cachet and lock in loyal customers for the long
      term. The wrong pricing strategy can rob a business of its competitive edge or starve it by failing to generate
      sufficient revenue to cover costs. </p>

    <a id="p147"></a>
    <p class="tx">In many cases a price is accompanied by adjustments that raise or lower it&#x2014;incentives,
      allowances, and/or extra fees. The amount a buyer will actually pay for an offering is seldom represented simply
      by the price listed for it. Consider tuition for education (yet another name for a price). A school publishes its
      tuition structure. The institution may offer scholarships and other financial aid that reduces that price. It may
      charge special activity fees that raise that price. It may charge interest to students who opt to pay over time.
      All those factors affect the price of a semester&apos;s course work.</p>

    <p class="tx">If you chose to pursue your education online, you participated as a buyer in the exchange of a
      quantity of money (tuition) to acquire a given quantity of services (education) from the seller, to paraphrase our
      definition of <em>price</em>. Interest in distance learning is booming as more people understand the cost savings
      and the convenience of taking a course from anywhere, and more people have the equipment and online skills to take
      advantage of those benefits.</p>

    <p class="tx">The fact that pricing strategy is complex is reflected in the many terms used for <em>price</em>.
      Contemplate the number of ways we refer to prices by matching the terms in Table 5.1 with the offering they
      purchase. See table 5.2 for answers.</p>

      <p class="photo-caption">The brand image a company selects affects the price of its merchandise, since price
        reinforces brand identity. A luxury offering cannot be bargain priced and still maintain its high-end
        positioning.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.1.1">Price and the Marketing Mix</h2>

    <p class="tx">The marketing mix, as you have learned in previous chapters, consists of the four Ps of product,
      place, price, and promotion. From the marketing orientation, which places customers at the center of all marketing
      mix decisions, we recognize that pricing strategy must begin with understanding how customers decide what to pay
      for what they buy. Price can be led or driven by the other four Ps of the marketing mix but cannot be divorced
      from them.</p>

    <p class="tx">As you learned in Chapter 1, the customer value equation (the relationship between perceived benefits
      and the sacrifice required to get those benefits) is dynamic. As perceived benefits increase, value increases; so
      does the customer&apos;s estimation of a fair price for those benefits. This illustrates how a pricing strategy
      interacts with other aspects of the marketing mix.</p>

    <p class="tx">Factors affecting the price a company charges for its offerings include customer expectations,
      competitors&apos; pricing strategies, and the brand image a company has chosen to project, since price reinforces
      brand identity. A luxury offering like a cruise cannot be priced below a certain amount and maintain its luxury
      aura, nor can a bargain offering like bulk-pack paper towels be priced above a certain point and still maintain
      its value positioning. Similarly, customer expectations and competitors&apos; prices determine a range outside of
      which a price fails to be perceived as a good value.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.1.2">Customers&apos; Expectations and Pricing Strategy</h2>

    <p class="tx">Consumers must assess the value they&apos;ll place on an offering, which means estimating what service
      it will render. Does it fill a basic need or something less urgent? This is the realm of psychology, where
      motivation, belief, and perception come into play. Let&apos;s look at how the psychological factors influencing
      buyers&apos; purchase behavior shape sellers&apos; pricing decisions.</p>

    <p class="tx">The entire purchase situation affects consumers&apos; perception of value. In the bricks-and-mortar
      world, how products are displayed, what items are nearby for comparison, how helpful the sales staff is, how
      attractive the store seems&#x2014;all of these affect consumer perception and thus expectations about prices.
      Likewise, online shoppers look for ease of navigation and comparison among offerings, clear explanations of
      shipping and return policies, and customer testimonials to help them form perceptions about price. And of course,
      many people blend online and bricks-and-mortar shopping behavior concerning price before making a
      purchase&#x2014;for example, choosing to avoid shipping charges by having a product delivered for pickup at a
      nearby store.</p>

    <a id="p149"></a>
    <p class="tx">Interestingly, consumers are prone to perceive the purchase situation inaccurately and to react to
      their inaccurate evaluation of the situation. If the brochure for your whale-watching cruise to Alaska depicted
      whales airborne in gymnastic leaps, and yet as a traveler you only witness a few humps breaking the ocean&apos;s
      surface, you could feel your cruise was overpriced. </p>

    <p class="tx">Fortunately, the psychology of price perception and assignment of value has been well researched
      (Nagle &amp; Holden, 1995). What does that research tell us? </p>

    <p class="tx">First, marketers should be aware of <strong>reference pricing</strong>&#x2014;the concept that
      consumers hold reference points in mind regarding the expected price of many offerings. Whether remembered,
      researched, or inferred from the buying situation, the reference price represents &quot;a fair price&quot; in the
      consumer&apos;s mind. The reference price is often a price range. The width of that price range held in the
      consumer&apos;s mind affects his or her judgment of the attractiveness of a posted price. Changes in context
      around the offering for sale can bring about changes in the price range evoked in consumers&apos; minds and thus
      change perceptions of the attractiveness of a specific price (Janiszewski &amp; Lichtenstein, 1999). </p>

    <p class="tx">For an example, consider a Le Creuset iron skillet. The same product is available through several
      online retailers, including <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://Williams-Sonoma.com">Williams-Sonoma.com</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://AllModern.com">AllModern.com</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://CutleryandMore.com">CutleryandMore.com</a>, and of course, <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>. Each product listing includes a &quot;suggested price&quot; of $250 to
      $285 and a &quot;sale price&quot; within a few cents of $200 (Streitfeld, 2016). Thanks to the skillet&apos;s
      reference price range, the savvy chef knows that $200 is a fair price. </p>

    <p class="tx">Customers typically know the prices of items they buy frequently. Their reference price ranges on
      those items act as <strong>signposts</strong> that signal a store&apos;s prices in general (Anderson &amp;
      Simester, 2003). If a store charges more than expected for Coca-Cola, for example, a consumer is likely to assume
      that all items in the store are more expensive than they should be. Most people lack the time and inclination to
      research stores and compare brands to be sure they are getting the best deal. Perceptual cues such as sale signs
      and prices ending in 9 are surprisingly effective in influencing consumers&apos; beliefs about prices. Reference
      pricing, signposts, and perceptual cues are all factors in consumers&apos; assessment of price and value.</p>

    <p class="tx">Other factors that influence perceptions of price include promotions, such as &quot;buy one, get one
      free&quot; offers that invoke mental math leading to a favorable assessment of the posted price, and marketing
      that links a specific purchase with a social cause or issue.</p>

    <p class="tx">Finally, marketers must recognize potential buyers&apos; resistance to change. When a purchase will
      require buyers to spend on additional goods or services to gain its full value, they hesitate. This spending,
      termed <strong>switching costs</strong>, can take several forms: Opportunity, implementation, and conversion can
      each carry costs not included in the offering&apos;s price, and they place a burden on the buyer, as the following
      examples show. A member of an airline&apos;s frequent flier program considering a switch to another will face an
      opportunity cost: The new program will bring some additional benefits, but the flier will have to surrender perks
      of his or her previous program. Implementation may require additional purchases, such as Apple&apos;s iPhone 7,
      released in 2016, which did not include a headphone jack. Users needed to purchase Lightning or Bluetooth
      headphones, which were more expensive than traditional earbuds and other headsets that used the traditional 3.5mm
      connector. A business switching software for its clerical workforce might have to spend on employee training or
      conversion of existing template documents. </p>

    <a id="p150"></a>
    <p class="tx">Companies can respond to, but not change, how consumers&apos; minds work. Buyer psychology&#x2014;why
      people buy things&#x2014;must be taken into account as marketers develop a strategic marketing mix. Pricing
      decisions will reflect this.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.1.3">Elasticity of Demand</h2>

    <p class="tx">Customers&apos; expectations have a profound impact on pricing, as has just been shown. So do the
      economic concepts of <strong>supply and demand</strong>. <em>Supply</em> represents the amount of a product
      sellers make available and <em>demand</em> the amount buyers want to purchase. When supply exceeds demand, buyers
      have greater control over the price suppliers can charge for an offering. When demand exceeds supply, sellers have
      greater control over pricing. </p>

    <p class="tx">Supply and demand curves represent this concept visually. The <strong>demand curve</strong> almost
      always slopes downward as price decreases and quantity increases, because consumers will typically buy more of the
      offering as its price goes down. The <strong>supply curve</strong> slopes upward as the price increases, because
      consumers will buy less as the price goes up. This model rests on assumptions that the marketplace follows a
      perfect competitive model in which no firm has influence over the market price and that a sufficient supply of
      buyers and sellers exist with adequate information about product qualities and availability. In this model, the
      point at which buyer and seller equilibrium meet is their shared <strong>equilibrium point</strong>, as shown in
      Figure 5.1. At this position, the price of an offering generates an equal amount of demand and supply for that
      offering. </p>

    </div>

    <p class="tx">Other factors in the marketing mix, such as product quality, promotion, and distribution (place), can
      shift the demand curve, allowing a company to sell more product at the current price, or the same amount of
      product at a higher price&#x2014;within reason. Shift too far, and consumer perception of value will falter.
      Prestige products, such as cosmetics, can demand a higher price because reference pricing tells consumers they
      have bought &quot;the very best.&quot; But if the price of cosmetics were to rival the price of a person&apos;s
      weekly groceries, he or she might decide to switch to a cosmetic brand at a lower price point.</p>

    <p class="tx">Of course, there are many determinants of demand, such as individual tastes and the existence (and
      price) of substitutes, in addition to the price of an offering. Even so, the model provides a good enough
      approximation of marketplace behavior that predictions based on the model are useful&#x2014;one reason it is
      considered fundamental to pricing strategy (Schenk, 2012).</p>

    <p class="tx">Let&apos;s apply supply and demand curves to higher education: The lower the tuition (price) for
      campus-based courses, the higher the quantity of those courses students will sign up for. The higher the tuition
      for those classes, the smaller the quantity those same students can afford, and so the number of course
      enrollments (sales) will decrease. The existence of substitutes, such as similar courses offered online, affects
      demand for the campus-based offering.</p>

    <p class="tx">Price changes affect demand. A product that a buyer perceives as a good value when priced at $50
      likely won&apos;t seem such a good value if priced at $100. This introduces the concept of <strong>elasticity of
        demand</strong>&#x2014;the degree to which demand for a product or service varies with its price.</p>

    <a id="p152"></a>
    <p class="tx">Demand for a product or service is considered highly <em>elastic</em> when a small change in price
      brings about a large change in sales. Demand for an offering is considered highly <em>inelastic</em> if a big
      price change has little effect on sales. Every offering falls somewhere between elastic and inelastic in the eyes
      of any given market segment; that elasticity of demand will vary from one segment to the next.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider your investment in education. Would an increase by $25 in the tuition you paid for a course
      change your decision to enroll? If you answered yes, your demand is elastic&#x2014;it snapped like a worn-out
      rubber band in response to a small upward change. If you answered no, your demand is inelastic&#x2014;a price
      change did not affect your demand, because of the high value you place on higher education.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers strive to position offerings so that demand for them becomes more <em>inelastic</em>.
      Companies selling products with highly <em>elastic</em> demand cannot raise prices, since demand will fall off.
      They must instead rely on controlling costs to generate profits. Companies selling offerings with
      <em>inelastic</em> demand have more freedom to charge higher prices and thus generate more profits. Branding can
      turn even basic commodities into premium-priced offerings. Consider bottled water: While many brands are accepted
      as interchangeable commodities, some consumers are quite willing to pay for the higher priced FIJI, Voss, or
      Perrier brands. </p>

    <p class="tx">Demand can fluctuate based on factors other than price, such as seasonality or environmental factors.
      Fireworks can demand a higher price as the Fourth of July nears, as can roses around Valentine&apos;s Day. Forest
      fires and floods can destroy crops, causing shortages that affect prices and demand. In some cases prices are
      governed by <strong>price controls</strong>, in which the government intervenes in the free market to protect
      consumers by setting a <strong>price ceiling</strong> or producers by setting a <strong>price floor</strong>.
      Examples include limits on interest rates that protect consumers from payday lenders (a price ceiling) and
      agricultural supports that keep farmers&apos; price for commodities above their costs of production (a price
      floor). </p>

    <p class="tx">Where the demand for an offering is highly elastic, consumers experience <strong>price
        sensitivity</strong>&#x2014;the degree to which the price of a good or service affects a consumers&apos;
      purchasing behavior. Consumers are sensitive about how much they pay and will turn to lower priced substitutes if
      the original item they wanted is too expensive. Some factors that affect consumers&apos; price sensitivity include
      the following:</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">the number of close substitutes </li>
      <li class="bl">the cost of switching between products</li>
      <li class="bl">the price of related goods or services</li>
      <li class="bl">the degree of necessity of the offering</li>
      <li class="bl">the percentage of the consumer&apos;s income that the purchase will require</li>
      <li class="bl">tastes or preferences of consumers</li>
      <li class="bl">the time available for making the decision to purchase</li>
      <li class="bl">consumer expectations about whether the price will go up or down</li>
      <li class="bl">whether the offering is subject to habitual consumption</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">One or a combination of these factors can shift price sensitivity toward elastic or inelastic in a
      given market. </p>

    <a id="p153"></a>
    <p class="tx">Each of a company&apos;s offerings might experience a different level of demand, with differing
      degrees of elasticity and price sensitivity, in relation to different market segments. No wonder developing a
      pricing strategy is complex! Marketers must estimate demand and price sensitivity when considering where to set
      prices. An estimate that misses the mark will hurt revenue.</p>

    <p class="tx">As has been shown, marketers need to understand the interactivity of pricing strategy with the other
      Ps of the marketing mix, how customer psychology drives perceptions of pricing, and how elasticity of demand
      affects their offerings&#x2014;that is, whether demand will snap (behave elastically) in the face of price
      changes.</p>

    <p class="tx">Some ways that buyer psychology affects pricing strategy are reference pricing, signposts, and
      perceptual cues. Also influential are sales promotions and links to social causes, which cast prices in a new
      context of added value either through quantity of goods received or quality of engagement with the brand and the
      social or environmental causes in the larger world.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Describe the elasticity of demand in the following scenarios. Would you change your plans for a
        family driving vacation if the price of gas spiked up? How about a designer handbag: If you worked in the New
        York fashion world, would you pay whatever it took to carry the current &quot;it&quot; accessory? Explain your
        thinking.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec5.2">5.2&#x2002;Strategic Planning for Pricing Decisions</h1>

    <p class="tx">Pricing strategy decisions are driven by situational factors, including customers&apos; expectations,
      competitors&apos; moves, and the company&apos;s brand position. Strategic planning leads to pricing decisions
      designed to achieve overall company objectives, as well as specific marketing objectives.</p>

    <p class="tx">Pricing decisions have far-reaching implications for the operations of an organization. These
      decisions must be based on sound strategy that takes into account four influential factors:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">cost to produce the product</li>
      <li class="nl">target market</li>
      <li class="nl">environment</li>
      <li class="nl">differentiation strategy</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">Marketers apply the strategic planning process (which was discussed in Chapter 2) to pricing just as
      they do to arrive at strategies for the other areas of the marketing mix. Figure 5.2 shows the four influencing
      factors of price decisions as inputs to the strategic planning process. </p>

    <a id="p154"></a>
    <div class="figure-box">
      <h4 class="figure-name">Figure 5.2: Inputs and processes of effective price strategy</h4>
      <h5 class="figure-title">Four factors are inputs to the strategic planning process by which marketers arrive at a
        pricing strategy.</h5>
      <img src="figures/fig_5.2.jpg" alt="Figure of the factors that contribute to a pricing strategy."
        title="Figure of the factors that contribute to a pricing strategy." class="figure" id="fig_5.2">
    </div>


    <p class="tx">Strategic planning cannot be done in a vacuum. The process must begin with situation analysis so that
      resulting plans take into account internal and external factors. Internal factors, such as the cost to produce the
      product, are relevant, as is the influence of strategies for target marketing and competitive differentiation.
      Meanwhile, the environment includes an extremely important external factor affecting pricing: the psychology of
      buyers.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.2.1">Input: Costs</h2>

    <p class="tx">A company&apos;s financial managers as well as its marketers take a great interest in this input to
      the pricing decision, but from different perspectives. While the financial manager is primarily interested in how
      high prices can be set to achieve profit objectives, the marketer is more interested in how low prices can go to
      achieve sales volume objectives. The two must collaborate to reach a coherent pricing strategy (Nagle &amp;
      Holden, 1995).</p>

    <p class="tx">Production costs set the &quot;floor&quot; price, below which sales cannot translate to profits.
      Consumers&apos; perceptions create the &quot;ceiling&quot; price, above which there will be no demand for the
      offering, given consumers&apos; estimation of its value. In between those two points, internal and external
      factors exert their influence on what the price strategy will be. Companies select a methodology by which to
      calculate price ranges (somewhere between that floor and ceiling) that will meet their organizational goals,
      choosing from the following approaches.</p>

    <a id="p155"></a>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><strong>Cost-plus</strong>: Adding a standard markup to unit cost derived by adding fixed and
        variable costs of production.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Target profit</strong>: Calculating breakeven costs of making and marketing a product,
        selecting a price to make a target profit above that cost.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Competition based</strong>: Setting prices based on competitors&apos; prices for similar
        offerings.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Value based</strong>: Using buyers&apos; perception of the customer value equation to
        design an offering that can be sold profitably at a price buyers recognize as fair.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Markup</strong>: Adding a constant percentage to the cost paid for an item to arrive at its
        selling price.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Increasingly, companies are turning to the value-based pricing method to ensure they are offering good
      value at a fair price (Kotler &amp; Armstrong, 2006). The value-based method offers the most potential for
      competing on real points of difference among offerings, thus escaping competition on price alone. By estimating
      the economic value to a customer in order to set prices, marketers gain fundamental insight to inform all
      decisions of the marketing mix. Positioning becomes the driver rather than price competition.</p>

    <p class="tx">The key to determining the price at which sales will be profitable is the <strong>breakeven
        analysis</strong>, which calculates the point at which a company&apos;s total sales revenues equal total
      expenses. This is the lower limit a pricing strategy must deliver in sales. The analysis is essentially a what-if
      exercise that projects the breakeven point, given specific assumptions about sales volume and pricing.</p>

    <p class="tx">The breakeven analysis depends on four key assumptions:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">the price received per unit sold</li>
      <li class="nl">the incremental cost, or <strong>variable cost</strong>, on average, of each unit sold</li>
      <li class="nl">monthly <strong>fixed costs</strong>, those associated with normal operations of the business</li>
      <li class="nl">sales volume (how many units will be sold)</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">Fixed costs remain largely the same despite changes in production volume, such as rent, insurance, and
      new product development. Variable costs fluctuate with production volume; for example, process materials or sales
      commissions.</p>

    <p class="tx">Managers use the estimate of sales volume to calculate the variable cost total and the total sales
      revenue (price multiplied by units sold). Estimating a specific sales volume allows them to perform the following
      calculation:</p>

    <p class="ext">Breakeven point (in dollars) = Total fixed cost/1 &#x2013; Cost per unit price</p>

    <p class="tx">Managers then vary their assumptions to see how changes in the estimate of costs, sales, or price per
      unit will change the breakeven point, as illustrated in Figure 5.3.</p>

    <p class="tx">Helpful as it is, this breakeven analysis method showing the effect of changing output on revenue
      hasn&apos;t taken into consideration consumer demand. Therefore, managers typically modify this approach by
      creating estimates of the number of units consumers are likely to purchase at each of a series of retail prices,
      taking into account elasticity of demand and potential buyers&apos; price sensitivity. These data can then be
      superimposed onto a breakeven chart to reveal feasible prices, as shown in Figure 5.4. With this calculation, both
      financial managers and marketers have solid data to inform a value-based pricing strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx">Breakeven analysis will reveal feasible prices at which sales will generate revenue, based on the
      seller&apos;s fixed and variable costs and the nature of buyer demand. It&apos;s important to note that additional
      factors affect price and must be accounted for. </p>

    <p class="tx">Another tool, <strong>price waterfall analysis</strong>, is used to model the actual profit the firm
      retains on a sale at a specific price after transactional costs that impact price, such as discounts and other
      incentives, have been applied.</p>

    <p class="tx">The price waterfall begins with the <strong>list price</strong> or manufacturer&apos;s suggested
      retail price, the price a company officially displays to buyers. Significant sums can leak away as buyers receive
      promotional &quot;give-backs&quot; such as free shipping, volume discounts, and bonuses for paying cash. That
      initial price is gradually nibbled down through transactional costs to arrive at the final <strong>pocket
        price</strong> the seller actually receives. The pocket price has to cover costs and contribute to
      <strong>profit margin</strong> (the amount by which revenue from sales exceeds costs), so it must reflect the
      breakeven point.</p>

    <p class="tx">In a complex distribution channel, nibbling might occur at multiple steps along the way from
      manufacturer to end consumer, creating a significant &quot;hole in the pocket.&quot; Figure 5.5 illustrates a

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.2.2">Input: Target Market</h2>

    <p class="tx">For this input to the pricing decision, customers&apos; perception of value, the elasticity of their
      demand, and their price sensitivity (which determines the maximum price feasible to charge) come into play.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers estimate the price sensitivity of buyers in the target market(s) using both the economic and
      psychological factors affecting buyers. Blending these factors, marketers can estimate a product&apos;s
      <strong>economic value</strong>, defined as the reference price the buyer assigns to the features that
      differentiate an offering from the alternatives available at the reference price. The differentiating value can
      include negatives as well as positives. Looked at this way, the economic value is the price that well-informed
      shoppers, seeking the offering best suited to their needs, would consider a good value.</p>

    <p class="tx">However, not all buyers make purchase decisions exactly as economic value would predict, because the
      expenditure is small (not worth the bother of evaluation), someone else is paying, or a desire to impress others
      causes the buyer to choose a higher priced alternative. Again, understanding distinct market niches will help
      marketers anticipate responses to various price scenarios, taking into account economic value. Given the arguments
      in favor of a segmented price strategy, understanding the target market means understanding many distinct market
      niches, each affected by economic and psychological factors in different ways.</p>

    <p class="tx">The target market input to pricing strategy emphasizes creating lasting relationships with customers
      by delivering a satisfactory customer value equation.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.2.3">Input: Environment</h2>

    <p class="tx">This input to the pricing decision covers the external factors influencing a company&apos;s pricing
      decisions&#x2014;economic conditions, intermediaries, competitors, and social concerns.</p>

    <a id="p159"></a>
    <p class="tx">Economic factors such as recession, inflation, and changes in interest rates affect the macro
      environment&#x2014;competitors and consumers all feel the same pressures. A price increase may be needed to cover
      costs of production hurt by negative economic trends, and yet prospective buyers&#x2014;also feeling the
      pinch&#x2014;may be more price sensitive than ever. Competitors and channel partners may react to economic forces
      with their own price adjustments. Both consumers and business leaders increasingly place expectations of social
      sustainability on companies, creating the triple bottom line of responsibility for social and environmental
      impacts as well as financial profitability. Any or all of these factors can alter the assumptions driving a
      breakeven analysis.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers must consider the nature of the marketplace in which a company competes, taking into account
      how many and what kind of competitors exist and whether the offerings for sale are uniform commodities or highly
      differentiated offerings. Sellers of undifferentiated offerings have little power to increase their price without
      losing sales volume, unlike sellers of highly differentiated goods or services. And this leads us to the final
      input to the pricing decision: differentiation strategy.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.2.4">Input: Differentiation Strategy</h2>

    <p class="tx">This input to the pricing decision involves an offering&apos;s positioning strategy, which in turn
      flows from market segmentation and targeting. This is where consumers&apos; perception of the expanded product
      (discussed in Chapter 3) comes into play: the desirability of the brand, based on its ability to differentiate
      itself from competitors on attributes that matter to consumers. </p>

    <p class="tx">In 1980 American economist and Harvard Business School professor Theodore Levitt wrote:</p>

    <p class="ext">Any product can, in principle, be distinguished from the commodity mass. The key is recognizing that
      what buyers purchase is more than just the physical product or particular service exchanged. They buy an entire
      package&#x2014;including the ease of purchase, terms of credit, reliability of delivery, pleasantness of personal
      interactions, fairness in handling complaints, and so on&#x2014;that is called the augmented [enhanced] product.
      Even when the physical product or service is immutable, the augmented product is invariably differentiable. (pp.
      58, 83&#x2013;91)</p>

    <p class="tx">Differentiation strategies were covered in Chapter 3. What&apos;s important to realize, in applying
      that knowledge as an input to pricing decisions, is the tremendous effect that product strategy has on
      price&#x2014;and the effect that price has on product strategy, since it supports product positioning.</p>

    <p class="tx">Let&apos;s consider one of the ways product strategy affects pricing: product line pricing.</p>

    <p class="tx">Buyers&apos; psychological reference pricing comes into play in evaluating individual products in a
      product line. When items with added features are priced in increments, the cost difference between the products
      signals quality or feature differences. For example, a line of Black &amp; Decker Dirt Devil hand vacuums begins
      with a basic model, topped by several more expensive models promising added power and useful accessories at
      incrementally higher prices.</p>

    <a id="p160"></a>
    <p class="tx">Sellers naturally want to sell more of the more expensive items. But buyers will rarely opt for the
      highest priced item, not wanting to be seen as ostentatious consumers or &quot;easy marks.&quot; A simple response
      in pricing strategy is to set the price of the most expensive item in the line quite high, in effect ratcheting up
      the other prices in relation to it, which will thus position them as better values by comparison. As long as the
      seller&apos;s marketing messages convey quality differences between the offerings, the strategy delivers perceived
      value to buyers and profits to the seller.</p>

    <p class="tx">In conclusion, a company&apos;s strategic planning to determine pricing strategy must consider four
      factors. Production costs must be calculated to determine a breakeven point that takes into account fixed and
      variable costs. The target market&apos;s perception of the product&apos;s economic value must be understood.
      External environmental factors will affect the success of any pricing strategy. Aspects of the offering that
      differentiate it from competing options affect the customer value equation, and so product strategy must also be
      included in strategic planning to determine pricing.</p>

        Considering this trend, do you feel some form of government regulation to protect consumers is necessary?</p>
    </div>



    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec5.3">5.3&#x2002;Pricing Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics</h1>

    <p class="tx">A company&apos;s pricing strategy reflects the sum of its activities aimed at finding a product&apos;s
      optimum price. Pricing strategy takes into account overall marketing objectives, consumer demand, product
      attributes, competitors&apos; pricing, and market and economic trends. The prices consumers encounter in
      advertising and at the point of sale are just the tip of the iceberg. The company cannot set a price higher or
      lower than customers expect. Competitors&apos; pricing also constrains the price range a company can charge and
      yet remain competitive. And intangible factors, like a musician&apos;s loyalty to his longtime fans, can influence
      pricing decisions in seemingly irrational ways.</p>

    <p class="tx">Certain overarching questions must be addressed as a company develops pricing objectives, which will
      drive choices of strategy and tactics to come. Will it choose to emphasize volume or profit? For how long? And
      will it adopt a fixed or variable approach?</p>

    <a id="p161"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.3.1">Objective: Volume or Profit Maximization?</h2>

    <p class="tx">The question of volume or profit maximization is answered by what a company wants to achieve through
      pricing. Because pricing objectives form the basis for subsequent decisions, they should be stated in measurable
      terms, with a specific time frame.</p>

    <p class="tx">In the <strong>volume maximization</strong> approach, the company&apos;s primary objective is to
      generate as much sales volume as possible (number of units sold). Prices are set low, even below cost, in order to
      draw more sales. A firm might choose volume maximization during its start-up phase or during a period of setbacks
      that make short-run losses an acceptable tradeoff for increased likelihood of survival. Volume maximization is a
      short-term strategy intended to generate sales volume quickly. This can be effective to build up cash on hand,
      expand a customer base, attract customers from competitors, or dispose of unwanted inventory. The underlying goal
      is often to increase market share and reduce costs, resulting in long-term profits. </p>

    <p class="tx">On the other hand, the pricing objective of the <strong>profit maximization</strong> approach is to
      generate the highest net income over time. The main difference between volume maximization and profit maximization
      is the financial effect. Profit maximization requires that all sales maintain acceptable profit margins. Profit
      maximization addresses the profit objective directly with a focus on positioning a brand for long-term success.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">When Starbucks raised its beverage prices by an average of 1% in 2013, the company&apos;s net income
      was already healthy, and coffee prices were falling&#x2014;so what was the justification for this price increase?
      Profit maximization. The Great Recession of 2007&#x2013;2009 had already caused Starbucks&apos; more
      price-sensitive customers to trade down to cheaper options (McDonald&apos;s had introduced its McCaf&#xE9; coffee
      drinks in 2009). Starbucks&apos; loyal, higher income consumers were less price sensitive (an example of inelastic
      demand). Paying a dime more for what they viewed as &quot;an affordable luxury&quot; would not faze them.
      Starbucks&apos; marketing communications associated the increased price with an increase in commodity costs and
      emphasized that less than a third of beverages were affected, making the price increase seem insignificant.
      Starbucks generated higher net income, without affecting the brand&apos;s reputation with consumers, by maximizing
      the profit on every beverage sold. This is an example of a value-based strategy, discussed earlier (Dawson, 2013).
    </p>

    <p class="tx">In many cases profit maximization is the overarching objective, but volume maximization takes
      temporary priority&#x2014;for example, near the end of a quarter or fiscal year. In some businesses with a social
      mission, making sufficient profits to sustain operations takes priority over a &quot;more is better&quot;
      objective. Before marketers can establish the pricing strategy that will form the basis for day-to-day decisions,
      they need deep understanding of overall company strategy and pricing objectives.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.3.2">Strategy: One Price or Many? </h2>

    <p class="tx">The varying price sensitivity among market segments introduces the possibility of charging different
      prices to different segments. When different market segments have different perceptions of value, a different
      price can be charged to different customers or at different times. With this <strong>variable pricing
        strategy</strong>, a company can generate more revenue from market niches willing to pay higher prices and still
      maintain sales to those placing a lower value on that offering. </p>

    <a id="p162"></a>
    <p class="tx">On the other hand, a <strong>fixed pricing strategy</strong>, in which the same price is charged to
      all customers, is easier to administer. Training the customer service staff and accounting for sales is easier,
      but the rigidity of this policy can seem unfriendly to customers, and revenue opportunities could be lost. If a
      company chooses a fixed price strategy, it must decide whether to occupy the high-, average-, or low-price
      position. </p>

    <p class="tx">The goal of variable pricing is to ensure that companies are selling the right product to the right
      consumer at the right price, while steering clear of illegal practices. U.S. law prohibits <strong>price
        discrimination</strong>, defined as the practice of charging different prices to different buyers for goods of
      like grade or quality.</p>

    <p class="tx">The norms of specific industries tend to define which companies opt for a variable pricing strategy.
      The tiered pricing plans common among cell phone carriers are an example of a variable pricing strategy designed
      to avoid problems with overburdening existing networks while allowing carriers to make money from mobile data and
      applications, rather than just voice minutes (Wortham, 2011). Tiered pricing is legal because each tier represents
      a bundle of different service options for calls, text messaging, and data usage. </p>

    <p class="tx">The primary disadvantage of a variable pricing approach is the potential to run afoul of laws
      prohibiting price discrimination, while the advantage is the potential to experiment with price points to maximize
      the profitability of each customer. Given that computers are typically involved in calculating prices and that big
      data on customers is available for analysis, the potential to run real-time experiments (for example, an online
      retailer cutting prices for a few hours to see whether demand is stimulated) gives variable pricing a strategic
      advantage.</p>

    <p class="tx">Variable pricing is accepted in many parts of the world. Haggling is an ancient form of variable
      pricing. North Americans tend to expect marketers to practice a one-price policy, representing the fundamental
      fairness of a democracy. A company&apos;s strategic decision to pursue a fixed or variable pricing strategy must
      take this into account.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.3.3">Pricing Tactics for Every Situation</h2>

    <p class="tx">Having chosen an objective of either volume or profit maximization, as well as a one-price or variable
      pricing strategy, it falls to marketers to fine-tune their choice of pricing strategy with tactics that fit the
      specifics of their situation.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers in service industries can adopt <strong>peak-load pricing</strong> to counter the
      perishability of their offerings. Similarly, marketers can adopt <strong>yield management</strong> to exploit
      timing to generate sales while managing a fixed, perishable capacity. Most people have had experience with
      airlines&apos; use of price changes to profitably manage the fit of a fixed supply to a varying demand. Airlines
      change prices frequently&#x2014;even minute by minute&#x2014;depending on their supply of seats and demand for
      them.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers can position themselves as the low-cost provider with strategic use of <strong>loss
        leaders</strong>&#x2014;products sold below cost with the intention to attract customers who will purchase
      other, profit-generating goods as well. Loss leaders are typically high-profile brands that lead to repeat
      purchases, like razors and printers, or services like oil changes.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers can adopt a <strong>cocreation model</strong>, in which customers bundle options to design
      their own offerings that suit their individual ideas of value. Vans shoes offer an example: Customers can specify
      a shoe style, choose fabrics, and upload artwork to be printed on their customized shoes. This tactic attracts
      consumers who value engagement and customization. A company can participate in a <strong>dynamic pricing
        model</strong>, in which buyers collaborate with the seller, allowing retailers to offset the threat created by
      price comparison, which drives prices down and narrows profit margins. Online auction sites like eBay are one
      example of businesses using a dynamic pricing model; hotels and transportation companies that adjust prices based
      on temporary fluctuations in demand are another. Coca-Cola tried dynamic pricing when it fielded a vending machine
      designed to adjust the price of an ice-cold beverage based on external temperatures. Temperature sensors allowed
      the machine to be programmed to respond to rising temperatures with a price increase. An outcry and threat of
      boycott, plus promises from rival PepsiCo to avoid such practices, caused Coca-Cola to end the experiment (Swabey,
      2007).</p>

    <p class="tx">E-commerce facilitates dynamic pricing, which gave rise to the Name Your Own Price (NYOP) variation
      popularized by <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://Priceline.com">Priceline.com</a>. Unlike the
      traditional seller-driven pricing model, in which the seller prices the goods, leaving the buyer to &quot;take it
      or leave it,&quot; the NYOP approach is buyer driven. In response, sellers opt for <strong>opaque
        exchanges</strong>, strategically withholding information from customers who may not know the exact features of
      their purchase at the point of payment. Processing is fast, and competition among customers is minimized since no
      one knows what anyone else is paying. NYOP gives firms more leverage in inventory control and pricing to different
      segments. But in the end, it may be a double-edged sword, making it difficult to predict profit margins and
      increasing buyer-driven sales by cannibalizing seller-driven channels (Huang &amp; Sosic, 2011).</p>

    <a id="p164"></a>
    <p class="tx">The <strong>subscription pricing</strong> model focuses on creating &quot;forever
      transactions&quot;&#x2014;ongoing revenue from loyal subscribers who engage with a company or organization over
      time, through automated payments that give access to goods or services, such as a subscription to Netflix or
      Dollar Shave Club. Some companies take this idea further, seeing a subscription as merely a financial arrangement,
      versus the feelings of belonging and engagement that accompany a richer membership experience. Caesars
      Entertainment Corporation&apos;s Total Rewards program is an example: The company (which sees itself as in the
      entertainment business, not simply as a gaming company) uses member segments to provide differentiated sets of
      benefits and offers and empowers frontline employees to use that data to make members&apos; visits special by
      offering a favorite wine or room location (Baxter, 2015). These <strong>membership economy</strong> businesses tie
      into timeless human psychology while helping people fill specific needs and desires. Subscription and membership
      businesses often deploy a <strong>freemium</strong> pricing tactic&#x2014;the term is a combination of
      &quot;free&quot; and &quot;premium.&quot; In this strategy, customers are given a basic level of service for free,
      with options to pay for additional value. MailChimp, an e-mail marketing software platform, is one example.
      LinkedIn is another.</p>

    <p class="tx">Pricing is tightly tied to consumers&apos; perceptions of a brand. Marketers can signal positioning of
      their brands by choosing a high-, average-, or low-price point in relation to competitors, as mentioned earlier.
      <strong>Skim pricing</strong> is defined by setting prices high to attract higher income groups for luxury or
      status goods. <strong>Neutral pricing</strong> is defined by matching prices of the general market, a decision
      that shifts comparison to other features of an offering. <strong>Penetration pricing</strong> is defined by
      keeping prices low in comparison to competitors&apos; and widely promoting an offering to quickly achieve more
      sales to more buyers. Opting for a penetration price works best when the seller intends to maintain consistency of
      pricing, forgoing use of sales events or other discounts that would lower revenue even further. Walmart long held
      this position with its strategy of promising &quot;everyday low pricing&quot; with few discount sales promotions
      (Perner, 2008).</p>

    <p class="tx">Penetration pricing deemphasizes market segments. It works where buyers are price sensitive and
      markets are large enough that thin profit margins are sustainable, but it is highly vulnerable to competitors who
      match low prices (Nagel &amp; Holden, 1995). This and other pricing strategies are shown in the graph in Figure
      5.6.</p>

    <p class="tx">In a marketing era that values long-term customer relationships, both organizational buyers and
      consumers have come to expect a degree of flexibility in pricing. While all the pricing strategies discussed are
      viable choices, those that allow for customer negotiations are gaining in importance.</p>


    <a id="p167"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.3.4">Segmented Pricing</h2>

    <p class="tx">An appropriate response for companies wanting to pursue a variable pricing strategy while staying on
      the right side of the law is <strong>segmented pricing</strong>, a tactic for separating markets into niches and
      pricing offerings differently for each.</p>

    <div class="photo-right">
      <img id="img5.3" class="scaled" alt="New Zealand and England rugby players."
        title="New Zealand and England rugby players." src="images/5.3.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Associated Press</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">Consumer resentment can result when the price charged to different segments doesn&apos;t
        reflect an actual difference in value. Adidas learned this when it charged more for team shirts in one country
        than another.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">A segmented pricing strategy is a natural extension of a company&apos;s market segmentation strategy.
      Segmentation can be an effective response to variations in segment price sensitivity and a useful tool for
      differentiation from competitors. When McDonald&apos;s offers seniors a discount on coffee, or a movie theater
      offers students a discount on tickets, segmented pricing strategies are at work. At its simplest, segmented
      pricing requires only two steps: (a) segment the market and (b) design a mechanism to charge each a different
      price. Both the McDonald&apos;s and the movie example segment people into groups based on their price sensitivity
      (seniors and students are consistently more frugal than other people), then using identification to determine
      eligibility, since students and seniors carry ID cards.</p>

    <p class="tx">In industries with high fixed costs, such as cell phone carriers and power utilities, segmented
      pricing is often essential (Nagle &amp; Holden, 1995). Without it, the companies could never cover their costs and
      still serve all the customers who need their services. Why don&apos;t all companies implement a segmented pricing
      strategy? Certain factors work against it.</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Customers don&apos;t self-identify themselves into segments; this puts the burden on the seller to
        identify segments with differing demand.</li>
      <li class="bl">The costs of managing the segmentation program can&apos;t be higher than the extra revenue earned
        by the differences in prices.</li>
      <li class="bl">Intermediaries can undermine the strategy by figuring out how to buy low and sell&#xA0;high.</li>
      <li class="bl">A poorly designed segmented price strategy can violate federal antitrust laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">An extremely important factor is that whatever price a customer is charged for the value he or she
      receives, that price should reflect a real difference in value from similar offerings purchased at other price
      points by other customers. Otherwise, the company risks charges of illegal price discrimination.</p>


    <a id="p168"></a>
    <div class="photo-left">

      <p class="photo-caption">Strategic planning to determine pricing should include consideration of product line
        strategy. When these items are priced in increments, the cost difference between products signifies differences
        in features or quality.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">There is also the possibility of an outcry of consumer resentment if prices charged to different
      segments do not reflect a real difference in value. This happened when Adidas charged more for rugby team shirts
      in the team&apos;s home country of New Zealand than it charged for the same shirts in other countries. In the
      summer of 2011, when New Zealand&apos;s hugely popular rugby team the All Blacks made it to the Rugby World Cup,
      national pride soared&#x2014;and so did demand for the official team jersey. New Zealand fans went into a frenzy
      when they discovered shirts were being sold online in the United States and Britain for about half the price
      charged in New Zealand. Local news outlets ran with the story. Anger escalated when it was reported that Adidas
      told online retailers selling internationally to remove New Zealand from the available delivery options. The
      Adidas brand image suffered as a result, to the extent that corporate sponsorship events were canceled and
      branding removed from company vehicles after staff members were publicly harassed (Hutchison, 2011). In a
      Marketing 3.0 world of connected consumers, discriminatory pricing policies will be met with consumer protest, if
      not a legal challenge.</p>

    <p class="tx">A segmented pricing strategy benefits consumers. It spurs competitive innovation when companies
      develop improvements that different market niches will value, thus allowing them to charge more profitable prices.
      Without segmented pricing, some small market niches&apos; demands would more frequently go unmet.</p>

    <p class="tx">Some segmented pricing tactics that have proven effective (and legal) include varying the price by
      customer segment, demand elasticity, price sensitivity, product version, seasonality, geography, and volume
      purchase. Other tactics include product bundling, in which the items combined increase the value for a specific
      buyer segment, such as an orchestra bundling concert tickets into a season package or an airline offering hotel
      and rental car bundled with the purchase of a flight.</p>

    <p class="tx">In conclusion, a pricing strategy must reflect overall corporate objectives regarding volume and
      profitability over both short and long time frames. Marketers may support the objective by offering a fixed price
      to all customers or a price that varies by market segment. Many pricing strategies serve different purposes and
      situations; those that allow customers to participate in establishing the price are becoming more important. A
      segmented pricing strategy holds potential to yield the most revenue, since each customer pays what he or she
      perceives as a fair price for the value received. However, this is the most difficult strategy to implement.</p>

    <p class="tx">In the end, successfully responding to the economics of pricing relies on marketers who must find
      product advantages that create sustainable competitive differentiation. This is the only way to avoid competing
      solely on price.</p>

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec5.4">5.4&#x2002;Adjusting Price Strategically</h1>

    <p class="tx">Our discussion of pricing strategy has focused on its role in the marketing mix as an influence on the
      quantity of an offering that can be expected to sell and the profit those sales will generate for the seller. Now
      the discussion moves to the strategies and tactics for <em>changing</em> prices.</p>

    <p class="tx">About half of all companies change prices once a year or less, but as many as 1 in 10 change prices
      every month (Kurtz, 2010). Clearly, for most companies, pricing strategy is characterized by frequent revisions.
      Marketers may change their pricing strategy to outmaneuver competitors or to achieve a shift in potential
      buyers&apos; perception of an offering&apos;s value. They may change prices to increase sales volume or to
      increase profitability at the current sales volume. With so many possible effects, it&apos;s evident that price
      changes must be addressed strategically.</p>

    <p class="tx">An increase in posted prices can be positive for a company but can anger current customers, who
      perceive a negative shift in the customer value equation when the price increases but nothing else about the
      offering changes. Price increases can be risky if marketers don&apos;t communicate a benefit, or at least a
      logical need that requires the company to pass on new costs to customers (as with gas price fluctuations). Thus,
      price increases need to be accompanied by strategic marketing communications.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers considering a price decrease need to decide whether the change will be a short-term
      strategy, lowering the base price for a stated period with a fixed end date on which prices revert to the original
      base, or a long-term strategy in which the new pricing strategy becomes permanent.</p>

    <p class="tx">Reductions from the base price can be part of the permanent pricing strategy. Marketers frequently
      create policies allowing cash discounts for prompt payment, trade discounts to certain channel partners, and
      quantity discounts to buyers at specified volume levels.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.4.1">Temporary Price Adjustments </h2>

    <p class="tx">For the rest of this discussion on price adjustment, we&apos;ll focus on short-term strategies that
      decrease prices. Note that these promotions are an integral part of the marketing plan that can contribute to
      long-term objectives related to product life cycles, corporate growth strategies, or other strategic aims.</p>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Sales promotions</strong> are short-term marketing strategies intended to stimulate purchases
      over a specific time period, by offering a reason to buy in addition to the service rendered by the offering
      regardless of price. The promotion temporarily shifts the balance of the customer value equation in the
      buyer&apos;s favor. That shift is intended to influence buyer behavior for the short-term benefit of the seller,
      for example by encouraging switching from another item to the one promoted, stockpiling of the promoted item, or
      creating an incremental lift in overall&#xA0;sales.</p>

    <a id="p170"></a>
    <p class="tx">A sales promotion is just one of many types of promotional campaigns a company can offer. (Promotions
      are discussed in the next chapter as the final P of the marketing mix.) A promotional campaign qualifies as a
      <em>sales</em> promotion when it involves a decreased price intended to</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">encourage new customers to try an offering for the first time,</li>
      <li class="bl">increase recall of favorable experiences from previous trial or awareness of brand image, or</li>
      <li class="bl">reward customers who have been loyally buying at full price.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Frequently, a sales promotion will be included in the launch of a new product or opening of a new
      store. Reduced prices for a limited period can be expected to generate excitement and reduce barriers to trial of
      the new offering or location. Companies will use sales promotions to counter the promotional activities of a
      direct competitor&#x2014;for example, by offering to match advertised prices. And sales promotions can be used to
      shift demand away from peak usage periods, as when resorts advertise off-season price discounts. Each is a
      variation on encouraging trial, increasing awareness and recall, or rewarding loyal buyers.</p>

    <p class="tx">Promotional pricing strategies can be used anywhere along the distribution channel&#x2014;as a pull
      tactic to encourage consumers to buy or as a push tactic to encourage distributors to sell, as described in
      Chapter 4. Consumer-oriented (pull) tactics include the following.</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><strong>Samples</strong>: Free products distributed in hopes of obtaining future sales.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Refunds</strong>: Money returned on presentation of proof of purchase of an offering.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Premiums</strong>: Items given free or at reduced cost with purchases of other items.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Coupons</strong>: Documents that can be exchanged for a financial discount.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Contests</strong>: Prizes given to winners who are drawn from a pool of entrants who have
        completed a required task.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Sweepstakes</strong>: Prizes given to winners selected by chance from a pool of entrants.
      </li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Cash rebates</strong>: Money returned on what has already been paid for an offering.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Bonuses</strong>: Payment or gift added to what is expected.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Trade-oriented (push) tactics include the following.</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><strong>Trade allowances</strong>: Financial incentives to purchase or promote specific offerings.
      </li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Sales incentives</strong>: Programs that reward intermediaries&apos; superior performance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">The feature these consumer and trade promotions have in common is that the seller forgoes some portion
      of the regular price to achieve one of the three objectives of promotional pricing.</p>

    <p class="tx">A price discount creates urgency to act, which can be very helpful in meeting short-term objectives.
      After all, pricing is the only P in the marketing mix that can be changed quickly.</p>

    <p class="tx">To be effective, discount promotional periods must be alternated with time periods in which no
      promotions are in effect. Otherwise, consumers set their reference pricing expectations at the sale price.
      <strong>High&#x2013;low pricing</strong> is a strategy by which marketers leverage this tendency of consumers in
      their favor. The company intentionally sets its regular prices higher than its target prices and then holds sales
      promotions during which prices are lowered to the target price. This strategy is most effective when consumers in
      the target market hold a strong belief that discount sales equate with better value for price.</p>

    <a id="p171"></a>
    <p class="tx">An example of a pull promotional price strategy can be found in stores that offered gas discounts to
      customers in the summer of 2011, when high gas prices added to the misery consumers were already experiencing from
      the stagnant economy. To stimulate shopping trips, some retailers and manufacturers offered discounts on gas
      purchases, recognizing that high gas prices were keeping consumers from shopping as frequently as in the past. The
      Publix grocery chain offered $50 gas cards for $40 with a minimum purchase of $25 in other products.
      Kellogg&apos;s asked shoppers to send in bar codes from certain cereals to receive a $10 gas card. CVS pharmacies
      gave customers a $10 gas card when they spent $30 on certain items (Clifford, 2011). These gas-discount sales
      promotions conveyed an &quot;I feel your pain&quot; message more vividly than the other strategy these companies
      could have chosen&#x2014;offering deeper discounts on products purchased in the stores. The sellers achieved
      increased sales volume with their promotional price tactic.</p>

    <p class="tx">Some marketers feel that offering discounts is a flawed strategy, suggesting that frequent sales
      simply train customers to wait for sales before they buy. While sales can increase recall of brands and remind
      buyers of past positive experiences, they do not necessarily engage consumers with the brand or build lasting
      relationships. Customers who get pleasure from hunting down discounts will likely go wherever the bargains are.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">The tactic of using sales promotions to reward customers who have been loyally buying at full price
      also has its critics. Some ask, why would a company forgo sales income? Others respond that rewards to loyal
      customers are justified, pointing out that competitors may be recruiting those customers with their own sales
      promotions and that customers appreciate recognition of their loyalty.</p>

    <p class="tx">Results will determine whether the criticism is valid. Sales promotions must be measured to prove
      their worth as a pricing strategy. It&apos;s important to measure the incremental sales generated by the
      promotion&#x2014;not total sales&#x2014;to find the contribution to return on investment (ROI) from the sales
      promotion. If the ROI isn&apos;t there, then there&apos;s a flaw somewhere in the sales promotion strategy.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.4.2">Sales Promotions as Business Model</h2>

    <p class="tx">In 2007, as the U.S. economy weakened sharply, the demand for luxury goods dropped
      dramatically&#x2014;and a new business model emerged online that had sales promotions in its DNA. Online retailer
      Gilt Groupe started a members-only site to sell high-end merchandise at deep discounts. That move launched a
      fast-growing trend: <strong>flash sales</strong>, featuring designer brands at bargain prices for very limited
      time periods (Khalid, 2011). Originally intended to unload excess inventory, flash sellers encountered problems in
      2011. Recession-affected manufacturers cut back on production, reducing the inventory available to be liquidated.
      The original flash-site sellers attempted to turn their business model from liquidating inventory toward
      spotlighting brands, having observed that many buyers who visit flash-sale sites soon buy merchandise from the
      same brands at full price. The advantage of the flash-sale sites began to rest more on their ability to gather
      consumer data (by tracking behavior on their sites) and less on the original inventory-management objective
      (Miller, 2011). By 2015 the flash-sale business model had lost some of its luster. As the economic recovery picked
      up speed, retailers no longer needed the aid of flash-sale sites to sell their products, and meanwhile,
      competitors to Gilt Groupe multiplied. Furthermore, luxury brand bricks-and-mortar retailers started investing in
      their own discount sales channels, both online and off (Rao, 2015). Is the flash sale approaching obsolescence?
      Customers will always want bargains, and limited-term offers generate a &quot;now or never&quot; urgency. How
      customers and businesses interact in the flash-sale business model will continue to evolve, but industry observers
      are not ready to write its obituary yet.</p>

    <p class="tx">The &quot;deal of the day&quot; site Groupon is an example of a business model designed to leverage
      consumer interest in sales promotions and social media. The company offers one &quot;groupon&quot; each day in
      each of the markets it serves. If a certain number of people sign up for the offer, then the deal becomes
      available to all. This gives the offer a social component&#x2014;by forwarding Groupon offers to friends,
      consumers can increase the likelihood the deal will become available. This reduces risk for retailers, too, who
      can treat the coupons as quantity discounts as well as sale offers. (Groupon makes money by keeping about half the
      list price of the coupon.) However, participating in a Groupon deal can prove to be an unprofitable prospect for
      retailers, who must use deep discounts to attract customers to a daily deal. Retailers need to carefully calculate
      how many coupons they can validate and still make money (Carrera, 2011). In 2017 Groupon rolled out a product that
      doesn&apos;t require customers to show coupons before getting deals: Groupon+, which allows customers to link
      their credit cards to the Groupon platform to get discounts automatically when paying for eligible items (Bary,
      2017). </p>

    <p class="tx">In conclusion, it&apos;s important for marketers to recognize how changing prices changes everything
      else in the marketing mix. Giving up profits is something no company would do without a defensible reason. Price
      changes can address internal objectives, such as a need to liquidate excess inventory, a desire to increase sales
      volume, or a way to facilitate campaign measurement. A price change can address external factors, such as
      signaling a shift in positioning to the target market. Any of these reasons offers sufficient benefit to warrant
      including sales promotions as part of a company&apos;s overall pricing strategy. It&apos;s important that the
      discount be used strategically&#x2014;that is, to address one of three objectives:</p>

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec5.5">5.5&#x2002;Challenges to Effective Pricing Strategies</h1>

    <p class="tx">Throughout this chapter, we&apos;ve made the case that pricing decisions must be strategic to produce
      results. But certain challenges counter any organization&apos;s efforts to develop and implement effective pricing
      strategies.</p>

    <p class="tx">Perhaps the most important constraint is the need to stay within the bounds of all applicable laws.
      Beyond the rule of law lies the moral ground of doing what is right. Today&apos;s consumers are harsh in their
      judgment and quick to share their opinions when they perceive a company as unfair to some or all customers. Also
      challenging for decision makers regarding pricing are potential conflicts of interest with distribution channel
      partners and the difficulties of selling in the B2B model. Taken together, these constraints increase the
      operational complexities of managing pricing strategies. A closer look at each follows.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.5.1">Ethics and Legality</h2>

    <p class="tx">Is it fair for different people to pay different prices for the same thing? Should a student and a
      millionaire pay the same for a gallon of milk? Should a person in the United States and in a developing country
      pay different prices for a cancer-treating drug? These questions are not easily answered. Discounted prices for
      those on fixed incomes, such as students or senior citizens, have been a visible part of retail pricing structures
      for decades. But less transparent use of segmented pricing can backfire, as examples mentioned earlier have shown.
      In a Marketing 3.0 world, consumers increasingly bring an expectation that they will be able to customize
      offerings to their own tastes, that such customization will not be reflected in high prices, and that in many
      cases they will be able to collaborate on what the price will be (NYOP) as well as what features are included in
      that price. These trends make more opaque just what each customer pays and what each customer gets, mitigating
      somewhat the potential of segmented pricing to be perceived as unfair. How marketers frame their prices as part of
      their positioning strategy has much to do with perceptions of the ethics of their pricing practices.</p>

    <a id="p174"></a>
    <p class="tx">Marketers not only risk consumer dissatisfaction but also legal sanctions if their pricing strategies
      are unethical or illegal. Since 1890 the federal government has acted to maintain fair price competition through
      antitrust law. The United States maintains stringent laws; the rest of the world is following suit, although
      traditionally European and Asian countries impose fewer constraints through law (Perner, 2008). Failure to comply
      can bring risk of substantial fines and even prison sentences. Practices such as requiring a customer to buy a
      less desired product in order to buy a more desired one, collusion among businesses to fix prices, price
      discrimination (selling identical products to different buyers at different prices), or predatory pricing
      (temporarily selling below a sustainable price to undermine competition) are illegal. A deeper study of pricing
      law falls outside the intent of this introductory book but is essential for any marketer responsible for
      organizational pricing strategy decisions.</p>

      <p class="credit">Associated Press</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">Channel partners can have conflicts of interest arising from pricing decisions, such as
        when a retailer advertises a sale price on one brand and thus hurts competing brands&apos; sales.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.5.2">Channel Conflicts </h2>

    <p class="tx">Members of a distribution channel may find they have conflicting interests. Any partner in the channel
      may seek to increase profits or sales volume at the expense of other channel partners. For example, retailers
      seeking to maximize category profits may offer promotional pricing on one brand and thus hurt a competing
      brand&apos;s sales, since consumers can easily switch if one brand goes on sale. Retailers may advertise a few
      highly discounted items to generate store traffic; the manufacturers of those items may resent the positioning
      effect of the deep discount, which can send a message that the item is low-quality or being discontinued. As
      discussed in Chapter 4, channel partner relationships are difficult to change, so channel conflicts arising from
      pricing decisions can cause significant disruption that is hard to repair.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.5.3">Selling to Organizations</h2>

    <p class="tx">Selling goods and services to organizations can be substantially more complex than selling to
      consumers. In a business, the single consumer is replaced by an organizational function, termed the <strong>buying
        center</strong>, in which several people participate in the buying decision. Initiators, users, buyers,
      gatekeepers, and deciders may all be involved in the buying center (Nagle &amp; Holden, 1995). Initiators generate
      purchase requests, users help identify specifications for the purchase, and buyers have the formal responsibility
      to authorize the purchase. Large organizations will have dedicated purchasing agents, while smaller organizations
      may be less structured, making it difficult for a seller to identify who holds buying responsibility or authority.
      Also influencing the buying process in an organization are gatekeepers, who control the flow of information and
      contact with the buying center, and deciders (who may be the buyer or may serve in a less visible role), who have
      the final authority to select a vendor. Businesses selling to other businesses need a sales staff knowledgeable in
      the subtle dynamics of the buying center. Too frequently, salespeople underestimate the impact or fail to
      understand the perspectives of the different individuals in the buying center.</p>

    <a id="p175"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec5.5.4">Managing Complexity</h2>

    <p class="tx">&quot;Strategic pricing is becoming a profession in its own right that bridges marketing, finance,
      sales, and top management,&quot; write Nagle and Holden (2003, p. xx) in the preface to the third edition of their
      classic text, <em>The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing</em>. In their view, strategic pricing is about much more
      than putting a price to an offering&#x2014;it means targeting markets that can profitably be served, communicating
      in ways that justify certain price levels, and managing processes and systems to keep fluctuating prices aligned
      with perceptions of value received (Nagle &amp; Holden, 2003).</p>

    <p class="tx">The humanity-centric consumers of the Marketing 3.0 era, who demand responsibility to a triple bottom
      line of economic value, environmental health, and social progress in the companies they do business with, are not
      likely to buy from sellers who fail to offer full transparency about pricing or that fail to involve customers as
      collaborative partners in creation of value. Pricing strategies must reflect authenticity, including authentic
      differences in value for each market niche under a segmented pricing strategy. Positioning strategies must reflect
      clear competitive differentiation, to move the conversation away from price toward economic value.</p>

    <p class="tx">The key to managing these complexities lies in tracking the effectiveness of the strategy in use.
      Information on how current strategic decisions perform is the best tool for deciding whether to change or maintain
      the current strategy, and if a change is warranted, what strategic direction it should take.</p>

      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 5.6: </strong><em>Finding the Best Value in Film
          Transfer</em>&#xA0;<em>Services</em></h1>
      <p class="tx">In the previous chapter, you learned about film transfer services&apos; use of distribution
        strategies as a competitive differentiator. Now return to the world of film digitization for a lesson in the
        complexities of pricing strategies.</p>
      <p class="tx">Visit three film transfer services&apos; websites (search &quot;film transfer&quot; to select your
        consideration set) and examine their posted prices. Assume you have three 5-inch reels of Super 8mm film you
        would like transferred. Can you compare prices? What factors, such as quality of transfer and turnaround time,
        affect the price? Can you ascertain which vendor offers the best economic value for you?</p>
    </div>

    <a id="p176"></a>
    <p class="tx">The concerns discussed above make any organization&apos;s pricing decisions complex. Ethical and legal
      matters, channel partners&apos; perspectives, and the functional and psychological factors affecting the buying
      center in a business-to-business purchase exchange are all challenges to any organization&apos;s pricing
      decisions. Pricing decisions directly affect sales volume and profitability, and they indirectly affect the other
      aspects of the marketing mix: what is designed into the offering to give it economic value (product), its effect
      on intermediaries in the distribution channel (place), and the objectives and effectiveness of advertising
      (promotion). In the end, it is the customers in the targeted market segment who make the decision about which
      offering presents the best value and who have the most input on a company&apos;s pricing strategy.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Apply what you have learned about today&apos;s consumer from this and previous chapters. Do you see
        challenges to effective pricing strategies arising from expectations of consumers in the Marketing 3.0 era? How
        is pricing strategy affected when consumers reach for fulfillment of their higher needs through their buying
        decisions, such as projecting a social identity through display of certain brands?</p>

    <h2 class="Case-Study h2" id="ch05casestudy"><strong>Case Study: </strong><em>Price War in Mariachi Plaza</em></h2>

        title="Violinist playing in Mariachi Plaza in Boyle Heights Metro Station in Los Angeles." src="images/5.6.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Associated Press</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">Many musicians in Mariachi Plaza have had to drop their rates in order to book an event,
        since the demand has dropped and more competitors have filled the marketplace.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">In a corner of the Boyle Heights neighborhood just east of downtown Los Angeles you&apos;ll find
      Mariachi Plaza&#x2014;a long-established hiring center for musical ensembles that play the traditional music of
      western Mexico. Mariachi musicians play party music for christenings, quincea&#xF1;eras, weddings, and other
      celebrations in Los Angeles&apos;s Latino community, wearing the silver-studded costumes and wide-brimmed
      sombreros characteristic of the Jalisco region. Mariachi Plaza, an established marketplace for the bands since the
      1940s, has become an attraction with huge murals and a bandstand. The musicians for hire there are professional
      entertainers who are well paid for their performances.</p>

    <p class="tx">Or were. A dispute over what they should charge heated up in the summer of 2011, reported in the
      <em>New York Times</em> (Medina, 2011). Since about 2000 the established musicians of Mariachi Plaza&#x2014;and
      their customers&#x2014;knew how much a mariachi should charge. The going rate had been about $50 per hour for each
      musician in the ensemble. A decade later, two factors were challenging the status quo: a 50% drop in demand for
      bookings and a rise in competition from newcomers, some willing to lower their rate to $30 per hour. Some also
      began charging only for time played, not including charges for travel and setup, which further undercut the common
      pricing practices of Mariachi Plaza. The old-timers shared an opinion that the newer musicians brought a lower
      artistic quality, lacked knowledge of the traditional song repertoire, and even fell short in their costuming
      (Hoag, 2011). Shouting matches and even fistfights erupted over who would get gigs, the <em>New York Times</em>
      reported (Medina, 2011).</p>

    <a id="p177"></a>
    <p class="tx">In 2011 roughly 150 of the 400 musicians formed a group to set a minimum price expectation (Hoag,
      2011). Those who joined the United Mariachi Organization of Los Angeles agreed to pay $10 a month and to hold the
      line at $50 an hour, in return for a photo identification card marking them as authentic practitioners with high
      professional standards. The organization helps its members deal with booking contracts; complaints of bounced
      checks and reneged-on prices have been numerous.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider the situation from the point of view of the (fictional) recently arrived musician Jose
      Aguinaga, whose talented ensemble, Grupo Danz&#xF3;n, was well respected in Jalisco before arriving in the United
      States. Should he and his musicians cast their lot with the professionals who join the United Mariachi
      Organization or side with the newcomers who, due to their lower rates, are more likely to find work? Pricing
      strategy is crucial to Jose&apos;s success in the music business.</p>

    <p class="tx">How is psychology affecting potential buyers&apos; decisions about entertainers in Mariachi Plaza? If
      they&apos;ve booked bands there in the past, they may be familiar with the reference price point of $50 per hour
      per musician established a decade ago. More recent customers may be unaware of the downward trend and fix on $30
      as &quot;fair.&quot; Customers&apos; perception sets the &quot;ceiling&quot; price Jose can charge. Jose will need
      a pricing strategy that recognizes his potential customers&apos; price sensitivity. </p>

    <p class="tx">Jose sets the &quot;floor&quot; with a breakeven analysis that factors in his fixed and variable
      costs, including instruments, costumes, and the pay he and his band members need to support their families.
      Complicating this calculation is Jose&apos;s need to charge enough to cover the periods when the band is not
      working&#x2014;unpredictable at best. Inputs to Jose&apos;s strategic pricing plan, in addition to costs, include
      the characteristics of the target market (with its reference pricing), environment (competitive), and his choice
      of differentiation strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx">Is segmented pricing an option for Grupo Danz&#xF3;n? Several of the segmentation tactics listed in
      this chapter could be effective: The band could vary prices by form (offering different musical sets designed to
      appeal to different market niches), by geography (charging for travel), by purchase quantity (offering discounts
      for multiple bookings), or by product bundling (adding party planning to the band&apos;s service offering), for
      example.</p>

    <p class="tx">Jose knows he must find a competitive differentiation strategy that will allow him to become
      profitable by charging higher prices. Jose&apos;s pricing strategy will have to be neutral, as opposed to a skim
      or penetration approach, because Los Angeles&apos;s mariachi bands have been experiencing a declining stage in the
      product life cycle relative to their popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, but mitigated by the steady growth of the
      area&apos;s Hispanic population.</p>

    <p class="tx">He must find a way to stand out for something other than price. As a newcomer, he needs to encourage
      trial by new customers who, if satisfied, will reward him with referrals and future bookings. Joining the United
      Mariachi Organization will position him as part of a proud heritage, &quot;the real deal&quot; among imitators.
    </p>

    <a id="p178"></a>
    <p class="tx">Sales promotions have proven effective to encourage trial. In sales promotions Jose has found his
      differentiating factor; few other mariachi bands have adopted this technique. To stand out among union members,
      Jose Aguinaga and his Grupo Danz&#xF3;n begin offering free samples in the form of music videos on DVDs,
      accompanied by coupons promising a 20% discount from his posted rate of $50 per hour per musician. On the disc, in
      addition to his band&apos;s traditional Jalisco musical stylings, he includes videos showcasing several updated
      genres Grupo Danz&#xF3;n has mastered&#x2014;including tunes by Beyonc&#xE9; and Justin Bieber. There&apos;s no
      group in Mariachi Plaza quite like them. Tracking redemption of the coupons will let Jose know whether his
      strategy is effective&#x2014;as will the buzz his unusual take on Mariachi music creates. (Will the videos go
      viral on YouTube?)</p>

    <p class="tx">Fundamentally, pricing for mariachi bands is a function of supply and demand. With demand falling
      relative to supply, the musicians are experiencing increasing elasticity of demand. Those who want to work must
      develop strategic responses, including finding new ways to promote themselves beyond the boundaries of Mariachi
      Plaza. Those who wish to use Mariachi Plaza as a marketing venue should respect its traditions&#x2014;including
      pricing structure.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Challenge Question</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">When customers grow accustomed to negotiating prices, whether through haggling, customizing, or NYOP
        exchanges, a company loses some degree of control over the profitability of each sale. Plus, consumers lose
        transparency about pricing when they don&apos;t know what each other customer paid for similar value. And yet in
        a Marketing 3.0 world, consumers increasingly expect to be able to customize offerings, and that includes
        collaborating on the price they pay. Choose a position for or against negotiated pricing. Explain your
        reasoning.</p>

    <h2 class="eoc-h2" id="ch05keyideas">Key Ideas to Remember</h2>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">The price established for a product or service is critical because the price affects the customer
        value equation. Psychological factors and economic principles affect buyers&apos; purchase behavior, which
        influences sellers&apos; pricing decisions.</li>
      <li class="bl">Inputs to the pricing decision include costs, target market, environment, and differentiation
        strategy. <em>Cost</em> takes into account the breakeven analysis, which sets the &quot;floor&quot; below which
        prices cannot yield profit and the &quot;ceiling&quot; above which customer demand falls off. <em>Target
          market</em> involves customers&apos; perception of value, the elasticity of their demand, and their price
        sensitivity. <em>Environment</em> includes external factors such as economic conditions, intermediaries,
        competitors, and social concerns. <em>Differentiation strategy</em> recognizes the interactivity of product
        strategy and price in creating a product&apos;s positioning.</li>
      <li class="bl">Economic concepts that affect pricing strategy include supply and demand, elasticity of demand,
        price sensitivity, and the breakeven point. In light of these effects, marketers should consider a segmented
        pricing strategy that identifies specific markets and matches differentiated offerings to them, because of the
        strategy&apos;s potential to maximize revenue, even though a segmented strategy is difficult to implement.</li>
      <li class="bl"><a id="p179"></a>Adjusting prices via short-term sales promotions can achieve strategic objectives,
        including encouraging first-time trial, increasing engagement between seller and buyer, and rewarding loyalty.
        Sales promotions must be measured to track their incremental contribution to sales.</li>
      <li class="bl">Pricing decisions are made more complex by challenges that include ethical and legal matters,
        channel partners&apos; perspectives, and the certain complications unique to business-to-business purchase
        exchanges. Pricing decisions interact with the other four Ps of the marketing mix, directly affecting sales
        volume and profitability.</li>

    <h1 class="h1" id="ch06intro">Introduction</h1>

    <p class="tx">Promotional activity roams far and wide across the landscape. This aspect of marketing can take the
      form of traditional advertising, personal selling, social media conversations, and much more. It can include
      immersive experiences and social experiments, like the Knorr Love at First Taste case study in Chapter 2. It
      reflects consumers&apos; decisions and actions as much as those of strategic planners in the marketing function.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">In this chapter, we begin exploring promotions with the core concept of developing and communicating
      branding. Then we move to how promotional strategies are evolving under the influence of media convergence and
      increasing capacities for one-to-one conversations with customers and prospects. The chapter closes with a look at
      the implications of humanity-centric Marketing 3.0 and access to global markets for the promotion aspect of the
      marketing mix.</p>

    <p class="tx">Promotion joins product, place, and price as a P in the marketing mix. Promotional strategy affects
      three decision areas:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">determining marketing mix strategies</li>
      <li class="nl">achieving effective market segmentation, targeting, and positioning</li>
      <li class="nl">enhancing revenues and profitability</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="tx">The need for organization-wide coordination and for integration of consumers into the process is
      fundamental to understanding promotion&apos;s role in the marketing mix. As you learn about the role of promotions
      in marketing, keep in mind this need for cross-functional coordination, the approach introduced in Chapter 2 known
      as <em>integrated marketing communications (IMC)</em>.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec6.1">6.1&#x2002;Branding: The DNA of Promotions</h1>
    <p class="tx"><strong><em>Promotion</em></strong> is defined as the function of informing, persuading, and
      influencing consumers&apos; purchase decisions. With that in mind, our discussion of promotion must begin with how
      consumers experience being recipients of all that communication. Receiving attention from a marketing organization
      is a lot like being pursued by somebody who wants to get to know you. Promotions trigger social cues deeply
      embedded in human psychology. Branding is the result.</p>

    <p class="tx">As individuals, we quickly sense the personalities of others we meet based on the social cues they
      send us, such as posture, appearance, and style. A <strong>brand</strong> does for a company what a personality
      does for an individual&#x2014;it presents a unique (differentiated) identity that hopefully attracts and retains
      social relationships. A flawed personality repels rather than attracts; so does poor branding. Keep this idea of
      brand as personality in mind as we delve into how a brand is created and communicated.</p>

    <p class="tx">In the marketing era born out of the postwar proliferation of products and services in the 1950s,
      marketers began focusing on positioning their products and services. They hoped to make their offerings stand out
      from competitors. Branding&#x2014;putting a unique identity on an offering (like branding cattle, the source of
      this term)&#x2014;was their best hope for competitive differentiation. Just as DNA is the carrier of genetic
      information, branding carries the personality information consumers use to recognize the branded product, product
      line, organization, or concept. Branding is the DNA of promotions. Branding is critical if a company wants its
      products to stand out among all the other products in an increasingly crowded marketplace.</p>

    <a id="p185"></a>
    <p class="tx">First, let&apos;s consider <strong>brand architecture</strong>&#x2014;the structure within a company
      that determines how its portfolio of brands relate to and are differentiated from one another. The particular
      brand architecture chosen by a company guides development of new products and line extensions, provides a road map
      for marketing messages, and reinforces the value proposition of the entire family of brands. Three types of brand
      architecture are most common.</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"><strong>Master brand</strong>:<strong> </strong>All products and services the company offers bear
        the organization&apos;s brand name. Example: FedEx. Whether you are shipping a package by air or ground or
        making photocopies at a local storefront FedEx Office, the overarching brand is always present. This strategy
        creates a strong association between a company&apos;s products and its overarching brand.</li>
      <li class="nl"><strong>House of brands</strong>: A company&apos;s products and services bear a wide variety of
        brand names; consumers may not be aware of the relationship to the parent brand. Example: Procter &amp; Gamble.
        It owns the brands Crest (toothpaste), Joy (dish detergent), and Vicks (cold remedy) but doesn&apos;t usually
        promote that P&amp;G ownership. This strategy is typically used to target unique and separate niches of buyers.
        It distances the brands from the company selling them and creates an impression of more product choices.</li>
      <li class="nl"><strong>Hybrid brand</strong>:<strong> </strong>Brands are given separate identities or not,
        depending on context. Example: Marriott International. The hotel brand consists of subbrands that target
        different segments of the travel market. The Ritz&#x2013;Carlton brand is owned by Marriott, but that
        relationship does not appear in marketing. On the other hand, the Courtyard and Residence Inn brands are both
        owned by Marriott and are marketed with the Marriott name attached. This strategy is useful when the
        organizational context demands flexibility.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="tx">Why would a company choose one architectural structure over another? The business value of brand
      architecture comes from its impact on brand equity, individually and together. Stronger brands can lift weaker
      ones, spreading their perceived value in a halo effect. The right brand architecture can make it easier for
      companies to expand into new categories or geographies or reposition themselves strategically. When Procter &amp;
      Gamble sold off more than half of its brands in 2014, it increased its focus on the consumer categories in which
      it had the most expertise: household and personal care. By pruning outliers (Eukanuba pet food, Pringles snacks),
      it enhanced its ability to support its strongest performers and invest in new product innovation
      (BrandingBusiness, 2014). Deciding the right structure for a company&apos;s brand depends on its marketing mix
      decisions and its understanding of its customers&#x2014;in other words, its marketing orientation.</p>

    <p class="tx">But brand architecture is primarily an internal strategy. For the external market&#x2014;the
      all-important community of customers and prospects&#x2014;companies need to set themselves apart from the herd.
      Brands need to tell a story. This story, termed the <strong>brand narrative</strong>, emerges from the ongoing
      dialogue that connects company and customer. While companies can choose a brand architecture, implement a
      well-crafted brand strategy, and maintain consistent brand communications, it is customers who create the brand
      narrative. Consumers interact with the brand through transactions and exposures, and they comment about their
      experiences through social networking and rating sites. Consumers ultimately control the brand narrative, using
      the information available to them in the marketplace.</p>

    <a id="p186"></a>
    <p class="tx">Within the brand&apos;s narrative lies its <strong>brand promise</strong>: the message that connects
      emotionally with consumers to differentiate the brand. The brand promise is closely linked to a company&apos;s
      value proposition in that it promises a specific benefit (value) from aligning with the brand (not just buying its
      products or services, but buying into its promise of value). The brand promise phrases the message of the value
      proposition in an emotionally compelling way that harmonizes with the company&apos;s overarching positioning and
      strategic vision. An effective brand promise will focus on only one or two benefits&#x2014;attributes that are
      unique to the brand, are relevant to the consumer, and can be expressed in a compelling way. The BMW slogan
      &quot;the ultimate driving machine&quot; leaves no room for doubt about its promise of high-performance
      engineering. The most effective statements of a brand&apos;s promise come from its customers&#x2014;what they are
      saying about what a particular brand does for them.</p>

    <p class="tx">Recall from Chapter 1 that positioning refers to the creation of a meaningful, unique identity in the
      minds of the target market, and from Chapter 2 that a value proposition is a statement that describes to potential
      customers why they should buy or use an offering from a specific company. These concepts, plus the new terms
      we&apos;ve introduced&#x2014;brand architecture, narrative, and promise&#x2014;overlap and interact, like
      spiraling strands of DNA, to hold a unique place for a brand in the minds of consumers.</p>

        for with its &quot;ultimate driving machine&quot; slogan?</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.1.1">Positioning Strategy</h2>
    <p class="tx">Customers may determine the brand narrative, but marketing communicators can influence them as they do
      so. This influential activity consists of positioning products and services. A company&apos;s positioning is
      central to how its brand narrative, brand promise, and value proposition are communicated.</p>


    <a id="p187"></a>
    <p class="tx">Positioning helps a company&apos;s campaigns stake a claim to a specific value proposition. Branding
      is the related task of presenting the positioning and value proposition through aspects of style&#x2014;selecting
      specific images, phrases, colors, typefaces, music, and so on to convey a specific attitude consistently across
      all campaigns and message channels. Branding even extends to company cars, staff uniforms, and headquarters decor,
      because a brand is essentially a personality. You express your personality through what you drive, what you wear,
      and how you decorate your home; so do brands.</p>

    <p class="tx">In January 2012 carmaker BMW of North America introduced new advertising that reinforced its
      positioning as &quot;the ultimate driving machine.&quot; The advertising tagline had been used continuously by BMW
      since 1975. The new campaign promoted the tagline to a company-wide slogan. As a value proposition, the phrase
      promises the joy and passion for driving pleasure that BMW has become known for (Levere, 2012).</p>

    <p class="tx">Positioning requires sacrifice, since differentiated offerings have specific value for specific market
      niches. Certain aspects are going to be more important than others to any given market segment. Some
      differentiating aspects on which positioning strategy can be built include the following:</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">image</li>
      <li class="bl">innovation</li>
      <li class="bl">customer service</li>
      <li class="bl">functional performance</li>
      <li class="bl">selection</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tx">Marriott International&apos;s Westin Hotels and Resorts brand launched a new campaign in early 2017
      that responded to a pain point experienced by many travelers&#x2014;maintaining their regular routines when on the
      road. Westin&apos;s marketers chose a specific positioning strategy for the marketing campaign, captured in the
      slogan &quot;Will You Get Up, or Will You Rise?&quot; Since 2011 (the last time Westin had released a global brand
      campaign), the company had been upgrading its properties with a focus on well-being (Paquarelli, 2017). Elements
      of the Let&apos;s Rise campaign, which included TV, radio, print, digital, and outdoor ads, showed travelers
      taking control of their well-being. Examples included getting up early to go for a run, eating a healthy
      breakfast, and experiencing a good night&apos;s sleep. &quot;Because morning is the first and best opportunity to
      take control of the day ahead, the campaign uses morning light as a consistent creative device to speak to the
      potential that the morning holds&quot; (Marriott International, 2017, para. 5), stated a Westin press release
      about the campaign, illustrating the extent to which elements of style support a brand&apos;s positioning.</p>

    <a id="p188"></a>
    <p class="tx">The goal of positioning, as shown by these examples, is to move individuals to action&#x2014;to
      recognize a need, consider options, buy, join, or recommend.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.1.2">Marketers Position, but Customers Determine the Brand</h2>
    <p class="tx">In his book <em>Differentiate or Die</em>, published in 2000, Jack Trout recognized that
      differentiation takes place in the mind of the consumer, writing, &quot;If you understand how the mind works,
      you&apos;ll understand positioning&quot; (as cited in Garment, 2011, p. 2). The consumer is the prime focus.</p>

    <p class="tx">Organizations do what they can through marketing communications to position a brand, but it is
      customers who determine whether the brand comes to life. Marketers are learning to adapt to this new environment
      in which they do not control the message but collaborate with the many voices of their customers to construct a
      brand narrative. Social media provides the tools, accelerating the many conversations taking place between the
      brand and its consumers, as well as among consumer communities&#x2014;including dissenters (Wong, 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">Experiential marketing is another approach that, like social media, draws the voice of customers into
      the conversation about a brand, in real-time, face-to-face encounters (events). This strategy directly involves
      consumers by inviting them to participate in some kind of experience. The Knorr Love at First Taste campaign
      profiled in Chapter 2 is an example. These experiences are designed to take advantage of the humanity-centric urge
      to connect with like-minded people in meaningful ways.</p>

    <p class="tx">Brands must behave like people in order to connect with consumers. People have friends; the parallel
      in marketing is a brand&apos;s advocates. These brand-loyal consumers lead the discussion around the products and
      services that stir their passions. Marketers collaborate with these opinion leaders to evaluate new product ideas,
      marketing messages, and even cocreate new products. Godiva Chocolatier taps the &quot;chocoholic&quot; female
      community to drive product development&#x2014;leading in one case during the economic downturn to the creation of
      chocolate lollipops as an answer to the need for little luxuries at easy-to-splurge-on prices (O&apos;Malley,
      2011). Some companies hire opinion leaders (for example, bloggers) to be ambassadors for their brands to specific
      customer communities. However, the use of compensation such as free merchandise, advertising support, or actual
      payment doesn&apos;t guarantee that brand ambassadors will return the favor with positive brand communications.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing communications has fundamentally changed under the impact of these customer communities.
      This coauthoring of the brand narrative tends to make traditional marketers nervous as they lose control of brand
      messaging. It shouldn&apos;t, though. Rather, this collaboration should be celebrated, because it helps achieve
      marketing&apos;s primary objective: customer orientation.</p>

    <p class="tx">Authenticity must be part of a brand&apos;s DNA. The brands consumers trust are those that
      consistently live by their values, communicating an essence that is consistent, believable, and appealing. That
      means something very different for Harley-Davidson, where the brand community expects an archetypal outlaw, and
      Dyson, with its promise of &quot;better living through better engineering&quot; (Smith, 2011). Given the vibrant,
      always-on conversation among consumers, losing credibility means losing a whole network of consumers.</p>

    <p class="tx">For an example of a brand built on authenticity, consider the story of a young British entrepreneur
      who became a YouTube phenomenon by teaching women how to create specific looks with makeup. As a teen, Lauren Luke
      experimented with makeup to counter her lack of trendy clothes and bolster her self-confidence. She began selling
      makeup on eBay. Luke soon discovered that photographing the makeup applied to her face rather than in containers
      increased sales dramatically. But responding to customer queries became so time consuming that she decided to make
      a video showing people how she used her products. Luke posted her first video under the name Panacea81 (on how to
      achieve the smoky-eye makeup look) on YouTube in 2007. The video went viral, quickly passing 1 million hits. Other
      makeup-tutorial videos followed, and within months she began making money from YouTube&apos;s sponsored
      advertising model. Within a year, Sephora offered Luke her own private label line of makeup. The authenticity of
      Luke&apos;s story was essential to the success of her personal brand (Wong, 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">When companies fail to live up to their brand&apos;s DNA, the fallout can be public and damaging. New
      York&#x2013;based State Street Global Advisors, a financial services firm, commissioned a bronze statue titled
      <em>Fearless Girl</em> that was installed on Wall Street in 2017. Its placement made it appear to be staring down
      the famous <em>Charging Bull</em> statue with its defiant posture of hands on hips, ponytail and skirt blowing. It
      was installed on International Women&apos;s Day&#x2014;March 7&#x2014;to celebrate the first anniversary of the
      firm&apos;s Gender Diversity Index, an investment fund made up of companies with a higher percentage of women
      among senior leaders. This sounds noble&#x2014;but less than a year later, the firm was revealed to be underpaying
      its own female employees. State Street Global Advisors agreed to pay $5 million to settle the claim (Stevens,
      2017). The disconnect between the firm&apos;s publicly promoted belief in women&apos;s potential and its own
      internal compensation and hiring practices garnered negative press and damaged the company&apos;s perception of
      authenticity.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.1.3">Managing the Brand</h2>
    <p class="tx">The point of coordinated marketing communications is to generate interaction between brand advertising
      in traditional message channels and the ongoing consumer conversation about the brand in social media. Today
      &quot;managing the brand&quot; means marketers are participating in consumer conversations, not just producing
      traditional advertising.</p>

    <p class="tx">Also important is consistently delivering an excellent consumer experience. Rose Cameron, chief
      strategy officer with Euro RSGC Chicago, said in an interview with Megan O&apos;Malley (2011) of the <em>Journal
        of Integrated Marketing Communications</em>:</p>

    <p class="ext">If what you design only lives in your outbound communications, but customers don&apos;t experience it
      in your customer service level or product level or retail level, etc., you&apos;re dead. If, on the other hand,
      your brand vision lives across all levels, you flourish. You can see this manifested by Apple . . . they&apos;ve
      incorporated it in the DNA of the brand. (p. 14)</p>

    <p class="tx">We recognize that now, customers create the brand through their experiences and conversations. What,
      then, can organizations do to manage brands over which they do not have ultimate control? Marketers can help
      consumers have positive experiences by satisfying their expectations of authenticity, transparency, consistency,
      and commitment to trustworthiness. The most effective brand conversations help consumers see that they share
      beliefs and passions with the companies that serve them. Brand narratives nurture that feeling of shared values.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.1.4">Measuring Brand Performance</h2>
    <p class="tx">Ideally, every promotion has performance measures built into its design. <em>Pretesting</em> before
      launching the promotion provides feedback that allows marketers to make modifications to improve the
      campaign&apos;s effectiveness. <em>Posttesting</em> measures the impact of the promotion and gives insight into
      its contribution toward achieving marketing objectives. Marketing metrics such as pre- and posttesting, which can
      measure either communication effect or sales effect, are discussed in Chapter 9. Listening to the consumer
      conversation provides additional information that answers questions research may have failed to ask.</p>

    <a id="p191"></a>
    <p class="tx">Tracking performance over time is an essential component of marketing management. By comparing how
      each iteration or evolution of the promotional program affects the brand narrative, marketers identify the most
      effective appeals, message channels, and consumer communities. Marketers should gather and aggregate data in a
      manner that allows them to compare the relative impact of various mixes of promotional tools, execution choices,
      and situational factors.</p>

    <p class="tx">Carrying out promotional campaigns is expensive and time consuming. Measuring return on that
      investment is crucial not just to justify that investment but also to gain top leaders&apos; support for the
      cross-functional organizational collaboration required to execute promotional campaigns.</p>

    <p class="tx">In summary, the implications of branding for marketers are many, but they can be understood in two
      main categories: the aspects under consumers&apos; control and those under marketers&apos; control. Customers
      experience the brand through many diverse points of contact, ranging from traditional advertising messages to
      conversations in which everyone from advocates to dissenters have their say. Marketers&apos; positioning strategy
      creates the identity consumers experience. Marketers&apos; measurement of brand performance (including listening
      to consumer conversations) provides the feedback necessary to keep the brand narrative alive and aligned with its
      target market.</p>

      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">&quot;The chief function of Marketing Communications is the creation and perpetuation of deep
        meaning through narrative,&quot; proposed Terry Smith (2011, p. 26) in the <em>Marketing Review</em>.</p>
      <p class="tx">Do you agree?</p>
      <p class="tx">Call to mind a brand about which you feel passionate. Describe its brand narrative and what it means
        to you.</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec6.2">6.2&#x2002;Using Promotions to Strengthen Brands</h1>
    <p class="tx">Consumers are receiving messages constantly; some are welcome, but most are easy to tune out.
      Marketers must break through all those messages if they are to achieve their communication objectives. Positioning
      strategy is the chief method by which marketers attempt to penetrate all that noise. Effective promotions position
      brands in ways that trigger emotional connection, stimulate conversation, and ultimately lead to a loyal bond
      between company and customer.</p>

    <a id="p192"></a>
    <p class="tx">Therefore, it follows that the ultimate mission of promotions is to strengthen brands in order to draw
      consumers into the brand narrative with companies that share their passions. Under that broad mission, there are
      usually more specific promotional objectives to be served.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.2.1">Objectives of a Promotion</h2>
    <p class="tx">Promotions strengthen brands by conveying messages to consumers, directly or indirectly, via marketing
      communications. Messages that are specific and highly focused are more effective than general statements.
      Marketers should choose a specific task to accomplish with each promotional campaign. Some common objectives, with
      examples, are included in Table 6.1.</p>

    </table>

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. Marketers target a promotional objective for every marketing campaign.</p>


    <p class="tx">Consider how the objectives in Table 6.1 differ. Once, providing information was all advertising was
      expected to do. Messages let consumers know what was available, supported with details about how to take
      possession of it. The directness of this approach is still useful when the authentic personality of a brand
      demands an atmosphere free of &quot;advertising hype.&quot;</p>

    <p class="tx">Increasing demand is the objective of most promotions. The aim can be to stimulate <strong>primary
        demand</strong> for a general product category, such as when members of the Self Storage Association advertise
      to encourage the public to &quot;Declutterfy!&quot; Or it can be to encourage <strong>selective demand</strong>
      (also referred to as secondary demand) by increasing the appeal of a specific brand, as in the PODS company&apos;s
      ads that feature the slogan &quot;PODS: moving and storage, solved.&quot;</p>

    <p class="tx">Creating primary demand works on consumer interest in an entire class of offerings, while selective
      demand leverages the differentiation of a product or service to make it stand out from others in its category. It
      is a common marketing practice for groups of advertisers to pool funds to increase primary demand for a product
      category in which they share a common interest. The California Milk Marketing Board&apos;s Got Milk? campaign
      presents an example.</p>

    <p class="tx">Compare the ad from the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board promoting cheese consumption with the ad for
      Perdue Farms&apos; chicken. The cheese ad is designed to create primary demand for the general category of cheese,
      with the hope that cheese purchased will come from Wisconsin producers (whose efforts are supported by a state
      check-off program whereby Wisconsin dairy farmers contribute funds to promote Wisconsin-produced dairy products
      through the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, an organization overseen by a 25-member board of Wisconsin dairy
      farmers). The Perdue Farms ad is designed to create selective demand for Perdue Farms&apos; brand of chicken
      products.</p>

    <a id="p193"></a>
    <p class="tx">Differentiating a product requires finding the value proposition that makes an emotional connection
      with potential customers. The advertiser must promise a specific benefit that no competitor can claim, in a way
      that compels potential customers to take action. The Avis We Try Harder campaign is credited with causing the
      company&apos;s market share to grow from 11% in 1962 to 35% in 1966 and was so effective that the slogan became
      the company&apos;s motto and remained in use until 2012&#x2014;50 years later (Parekh, 2012). Differentiation can
      be conveyed in many ways besides advertising slogans and jingles, of course. Design elements such as fleet
      vehicles, retail ambience, and website design all contribute to differentiating a product or service. Highlighting
      a product&apos;s value differentiates it on the dimension of price, emphasizing the greater service utility
      provided when compared to competitors charging the same price.</p>

    <p class="tx">Stabilizing sales is a helpful goal when demand for a good or service fluctuates. Seasons, usage
      cycles, and even weather events can cause changes in demand. Tourist destinations like Las Vegas run ads to fill
      hotel rooms during off-peak times of year.</p>

    <p class="tx">In Chapter 2 you learned about a method of business portfolio analysis called the BCG Matrix. This
      tool, which visualizes the relative market share of products and the growth of their market by assigning them to
      quadrants labeled stars, cash cows, dogs, and question marks, can also be applied to assess how a company might
      match different promotional objectives to different offerings, using the same vectors of market share and market
      growth. A promotional objective of providing information might be all a company&apos;s cash cows need, while its
      fast-growing stars might justify strategic investment in differentiating a product/service, thereby anticipating
      competitors&apos; countermoves, such as introducing &quot;me too&quot; offerings.</p>

    <p class="tx">These promotional objectives are not mutually exclusive. For example, a campaign can be primarily
      about increasing demand but also accomplish product differentiation. Nor is this list of possible objectives
      complete. A look back at Ansoff&apos;s Matrix (also in Chapter 2) might suggest more promotional objectives, like
      launching a product in a new geographic market or to a new customer segment.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.2.2">Components of the Promotional Mix</h2>
    <p class="tx">Message channels carry marketing communications. The choice of message channels to be used is a key
      component of the promotions aspect of the marketing mix.</p>

    <p class="tx">Promotional strategies will typically emphasize either <strong>personal selling</strong> (which can be
      face-to-face or via technology) or <strong>nonpersonal selling</strong> (through advertising, direct marketing,
      and other channels that lack the interactive person-to-person experience). Promotional strategies will use either
      push or pull techniques, stimulating end users or channel intermediaries, as was discussed in Chapter 4.</p>

    <p class="tx">Message channels are proliferating rapidly. Marketing organizations are starting to look at their
      promotional mix in terms of ownership, control, and desired outcome. The <strong>POES model</strong> (derived from
      &quot;paid, owned, earned, shared&quot;) was originally developed to describe online media but has proved
      applicable to offline media as well. This framework (depicted in Table 6.2) assigns each message channel to one of
      four quadrants based on whether it is controlled by the company/brand or by others over whom the company has no
      control&#x2014;stakeholders including consumers, commentators, and others.</p>

        appearances in film, television, or other media.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Sponsorships</strong>: Cash and/or in-kind fee paid to a property (typically a celebrity)
        in return for endorsements and other exploitable commercial potential associated with that property.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Public relations</strong>: Building good relations with an organization&apos;s various
        publics (customers, employees, investors, suppliers, etc.) through seeking favorable publicity and other nonpaid
        forms of communication such as support of arts, charitable causes, and so forth. Companies pay for public
        relations activity on their behalf, not to be confused with the resulting media coverage, which cannot be
        purchased.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Brand ambassadors</strong>: Individuals who serve as the face of their client company at
        promotional events.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Guerilla marketing</strong>: Unconventional marketing intended to get maximum results from
        minimal resources. The term <em>Guerilla Marketing</em> is a registered trademark of author Jay Levinson, who
        popularized it through his several <em>Guerilla</em> books.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Search engine optimization</strong>: Increasing the number of visitors to a website by
        obtaining higher placement in the search results page of a search engine. </li>
    </ul>

    <a id="p195"></a>
    <p class="tx"><em>Owned</em> message channels are distinguished from paid message channels by the likelihood they
      would exist even if not called for as a component of a specific marketing plan. The distinction between paid and
      owned media is somewhat fluid.</p>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><em>Company website:</em> The company&apos;s online home for information about its offerings,
        organization, career opportunities, and more.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Company blog:</em> The company&apos;s online journal consisting of chronological entries that
        typically include short articles and links to further resources.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>In-store marketing</strong>: Marketing dollars spent inside a retail store in the form of
        store design, merchandising, visual displays, or promotions.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Personal selling:</em> Personal contact by members of a company&apos;s sales force intended to
        make sales or build customer relationships.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tx"><em>Earned</em> message channels are similar to paid channels in that they exist for the purpose of
      communicating with consumers; however, coverage in earned channels cannot be purchased.</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><strong>Media coverage</strong>: Information presented in mass media about a company by reporters;
        may result from public relations activity.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Review sites: </em>Websites on which reviews can be posted about people, businesses, products,
        or services, such as Yelp and Angie&apos;s List.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx"><em>Shared</em> message channels arise from consumers&apos; interest in engagement through dialogue in
      online communities.</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><strong>Buzz</strong> (<strong>word of mouth</strong>): Anything that creates excitement or
        stimulus, such as a recommendation by a satisfied customer; leverages consumers&apos; interest to generate
        marketing messages.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Social network platforms:</em> Applications that allow users to post content, create profiles,
        and share information, ideas, and personal messages (Boyd &amp; Ellison, 2007). </li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Blogs:</em> Online journals consisting of chronological entries on which an individual or group
        of users regularly post their opinions, information, photos, and so on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tx">The categories in the POES model provide a useful framework for integrating marketing communication
      strategies across corporate functions such as sales, marketing, and public relations. A marketing plan can specify
      investment in paid and owned message channels. It can specify effort and investment to be directed toward earned
      and shared message channels, including paying individuals to pursue coverage. But a marketing plan cannot
      guarantee those messages will appear&#x2014;stakeholders, not advertisers, control these channels.</p>

    <a id="p196"></a>
    <p class="tx">Each message channel in the promotional mix represents a potential consumer
      <strong>touchpoint</strong>&#x2014;the basic building block of brand experience. The quality of the consumer
      experience at each touchpoint will influence consumers&apos; relationship with the brand, affecting subsequent
      actions. This fact challenges marketers to deliver compelling, consistent experiences through all message
      channels. Even an advertisement printed in a newspaper attempts to create an experience compelling enough that
      readers will remember its message.</p>

    <p class="tx">Just as the BCG Matrix can be an input to strategic decisions about product strategy or promotional
      objectives, it can be used to evaluate levels of investment in various message channels. Here, the axis of market
      growth would be replaced with channel growth, and market share would be replaced by return on investment of
      current channel. Thus, a company could judge its current promotional mix on which specific channels are growing in
      effectiveness and which are declining, leading to insights into how the promotions strategy should evolve. For an
      example, consider the decline of Vine, the short-form video app, as competitors like Twitter&apos;s Periscope and
      Facebook Live added similar features. Meanwhile, search engine optimization is rising as a brand-controlled means
      of increasing traffic to its website. Using the BCG Matrix could reveal a need to shift away from channels where
      return on investment is declining toward those that with stable or growing returns.</p>

    <p class="tx">Developing the optimal promotional mix to serve a specific objective is discussed a little later in
      this chapter; first we must examine trends influencing how various message channels perform. Effective promotions
      require that the promotional mix be coordinated with the entire marketing mix&#x2014;and vice versa.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.2.3">Coordinating the Message Channels in the Promotional Mix</h2>
    <p class="tx">A few short decades ago, making decisions about which message channels to use meant deciding how to
      apportion the budget between what was called &quot;mass-media&quot; and &quot;collateral&quot; channels. Mass
      media meant print, television, and radio advertising, and &quot;collateral&quot; meant everything
      else&#x2014;direct mail, out-of-home (outdoor and transit ads), and point-of-purchase materials. Then came the
      Internet. Digital media channels proliferated quickly. Today, in addition to mass media and collateral, marketers
      can budget advertising dollars for digital advertising, social media platforms, and search results, with more
      options emerging with every spin of the planet. Even when the promotional objective is clear, choosing among all
      those options is not easy. That&apos;s why specialists called <em>media buyers</em> (whose role is discussed in
      Chapter 9) typically perform this task.</p>

    <p class="tx">As a message channel, many marketers feel that traditional paid mass-media advertising is losing its
      relevance. Its nonpersonal nature, the difficulty of tracking results, and its high cost are all working against
      the &quot;old-school&quot; advertising channels such as broadcast and cable television, radio, and magazines and
      newspapers. The rise of streaming channels like Netflix and Hulu compete for the time people used to spend
      watching broadcast television with its commercials. But don&apos;t turn off the TV budget just yet&#x2014;a study
      funded by Turner Broadcasting and Horizon Media in 2015 found that TV is still an effective advertising medium. In
      fact, the study concluded that TV averaged 4 times the sales impact of digital media channels, given similar
      spending levels (Lunch, 2015). The importance of IMC was acknowledged in the study&apos;s conclusion that
      optimizing a mix of personal and nonpersonal channels improves TV advertising&apos;s effectiveness. Large brands
      that market to mass audiences and can afford broadcast television&apos;s high production and placement costs will
      probably always air commercials on television, just as they have since the medium&apos;s birth.</p>

    <a id="p197"></a>
    <p class="tx">But there are reasons to shift the budget away from television, even if a company fits the qualifier
      &quot;large brand, mass audience.&quot; The impersonal nature of mass media (and even targeted media, to some
      extent) detracts from its ability to engage the message recipient. It is less effective at stimulating action than
      more personal message channels. Technology that allows consumers to avoid advertising has proliferated, such as
      digital video recorders and advertising-free cable and satellite media.</p>

    <p class="tx">Traditional advertising was never a very effective option for businesses to reach other business
      buyers. Only limited advertising media options exist to reach businesspeople in even the largest industries.
      Personal selling has traditionally been the relied-on approach for B2B marketing. Personal selling allows
      relationships to build in which the seller becomes knowledgeable about the buyer&apos;s preferences, budget, and
      decision process. Personal selling is no less expensive than advertising media, however; both require significant
      investment. In the age of social media conversations, personal selling maintains its relevance, since salespeople
      are individuals who can credibly participate in social media. Traditional advertising has not held on to its
      relevance so well.</p>

    <p class="tx">On the brand-controlled side of the promotional mix, <strong>media convergence</strong> now
      characterizes many message channels. The messages delivered in the past through newspapers, magazines, books,
      radio, and television are increasingly delivered to consumers through one digital delivery system&#x2014;the
      Internet. At the same time media are converging onto the Internet, the screens on which those media are viewed are
      multiplying. Marketers are struggling to keep up with the latest menu of media channels, technology for accessing
      them, and consumers&apos; behaviors and preferences regarding the brand messages they receive through them.</p>

    <p class="tx">The <strong>best available screen theory</strong> explains consumer behavior in a media-convergent
      world. ESPN began to research cross-media behavior in 2002 with a study on consumption of ESPN media platforms. In
      2010 published results of ESPN&apos;s research revealed that sports fans might watch ESPN on TV while preparing
      for work, listen to an ESPN radio program in the car on the way in, use ESPN.com online to keep up with sports
      news while at work, and bring up ESPN Mobile on a smartphone while out and about&#x2014;choosing the best
      available screen depending on their location at any time. The advertiser who wants to reach those sports fans will
      need to follow them throughout the day, offering relevant messaging and building on each touchpoint (Enoch &amp;
      Johnson, 2010). The lesson for marketers designing a promotional mix strategy? Be where targeted consumers are
      throughout the day&#x2014;to the extent that budgets allow.</p>

    <p class="tx">Advertisers with deep pockets like those who buy spots on ESPN aren&apos;t leaving traditional
      advertising media behind&#x2014;they&apos;re following their target market from screen to screen. But companies
      with fewer resources or narrower target markets cannot do so. These companies must turn to other
      tactics&#x2014;like direct marketing or greater collaboration with consumers.</p>

    <p class="tx">As media convergence has left marketers uncertain how to best use mass-media channels, they have been
      turning their attention to direct marketing and consumer-generated marketing. In Chapter 2 the shift from
      mass-market toward one-to-one campaigns was discussed. This shift is bringing marketers back to the time-tested
      methodology of <em>direct marketing</em>. In Chapter 4 direct marketing was discussed in its sense as a form of
      nonstore retailing. Here we shift the focus to the other definition of <em>direct marketing:</em> a promotional
      technique that focuses on getting customers to take direct action, with measurable results.</p>

    <a id="p198"></a>
    <p class="tx">Direct marketing can take many forms, including direct mail, telephone sales, and e-mails. Like
      personal selling, direct marketing offers the potential for interaction between seller and prospective buyer. It
      can be easily customized to specific market niches and even individual recipients. The return on marketing
      investment (ROMI) is easier to judge, since direct marketing campaigns trigger specific responses that can be
      measured. Direct marketing requires sophisticated database technology to provide the customer or prospect data to
      address the campaign and to gather response data after they are delivered.</p>

    <p class="tx">Direct marketing has remained an effective promotional approach because a mix of methods helps
      marketers get more out of their campaigns. As e-mail has proliferated, direct mail has become a less cluttered
      media channel by comparison, resulting in response rates 10 to 30 times higher than e-mail (Pulcinella, 2017).
      Sellers appreciate that direct marketing is more directly tied to sales results and provides more data for
      analysis, leading to better targeting of prospective customers over time.</p>

    <p class="tx">Also drawing marketers&apos; attention are the social media in which consumers generate the message,
      through word of mouth and social media. The term <em>social media</em> was coined in 2007 to refer to social
      networking sites. Since then, social media (meaning web applications that encourage user-generated content) has
      become a respected marketing and communications channel (Wong, 2011). Consumers&apos; decisions have become
      increasingly influenced by their peers. Through review sites like Yelp, brand advocates enthuse about their
      favorites, and disgruntled consumers share their peeves. Consumers are more likely to trust these voices than to
      trust advertisers, even as companies become more active on social networks.</p>

    <p class="tx">In contrast to the era when a brand relied on paid advertising and its owned and earned message
      channels, today marketers have available a much fuller array of communication tools and the ability to use them
      more flexibly. A brand can use mass or targeted Facebook advertising and display ads on websites and its own
      website. It can deploy search engine optimization and hire bloggers to contribute to its brand narrative. It can
      offer short-term sales promotions through tweets and targeted e-mail. It can encourage brand communities to form
      on social network platforms. And perhaps most significantly, a brand can draw on constantly accumulating user data
      to fuel its segmentation and targeting strategies. Marketers can change and adapt their campaigns on the fly as
      they learn what does and does not work. They can summon the distinctive strengths of each message channel and
      sequence them in the most effective way to move consumers to take action (Batra &amp; Keller, 2016).</p>

    <p class="tx">How are marketers responding to this new era of integrated marketing communications? Consider the
      following example from the travel industry, in which hotels are turning to social media to connect with travelers.
      Their customers have increasingly moved to booking flights through online travel agencies. Once on those sites
      purchasing a flight, it becomes irresistibly easy to book hotel rooms that the travel sites suggest as add-ons.
      Hotels are attempting to capture those travelers&apos; bookings, catching up with them at the point where a
      recommendation turns into booking a reservation.</p>

    <p class="tx">Facebook pages for companies like Kimpton Hotels present a way to start a conversation with potential
      guests. By reaching out through social media, hotels make sure their booking engines are available where the
      customers are, rather than hoping the customer will look for them. The richness of social media lets hotels do
      more than just book a reservation&#x2014;they can engage in dialogue to find out the guest&apos;s preference (for
      example, what to stock in the minibar). That kind of personal service helps hotels give customers more reasons to
      stay, thus building customer loyalty.</p>

    <p class="tx">Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn are now used by 37% of the global
      population, or 2.8 billion people, according to a 2017 report from Business Insider. In the United States,
      according to that report, demographic factors like gender, income, and education have little impact on adoption of
      social media. What does impact adoption is age, with younger people gravitating to different platforms than older
      people and using them for different reasons. For example, people aged 45 to 54 spend more time on Facebook than
      any other age group, while people under 24 prefer to spend time in &quot;digital hangouts&quot;&#x2014;platforms
      that enable users to video chat with several friends at the same time (Gallagher, 2017). WhatsApp and WeChat are
      two examples. Chapter 7 will take a closer look at the concept of generational behavior patterns. For now, the
      point is that the promotional mix should feature the channels used by the target market (Gallagher, 2017).</p>

    <p class="tx">Social media must be seen as more than just an increasingly important message channel: It&apos;s a new
      genre of social communication. Consumers&apos; friends, peers, and even total strangers&apos; postings now
      influence consumers more than advertisers (Wong, 2011). The consumer-generated marketing content of these
      conversations is the latest twist in the message channel word of mouth. When people start sharing brand messages
      for their entertainment value, the buzz goes viral. Word of mouth is as old as the back fence and the corner
      store, wherever neighbors meet and talk. What&apos;s different today is that social media now amplifies word of
      mouth so that it reaches peer communities&#x2014;and beyond&#x2014;instantly.</p>

    <p class="tx">Buzz marketing is popular among marketers as a message channel strategy, especially when young people
      are the target audience&#x2014;the teens and 20-somethings who tend to be most skeptical of mass-media advertising
      (Kotler &amp; Armstrong, 2006). To be &quot;buzzable,&quot; a company&apos;s offerings need to be</p>

    <a id="p200"></a>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">exciting or innovative&#x2014;real news gets buzz that advertising promises seldom attract;</li>
      <li class="bl">a personal experience&#x2014;like travel or entertainment&#x2014;that moves an individual
        emotionally; and</li>
      <li class="bl">best of class&#x2014;or the buzz will be negative.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">The first campaign acknowledged in the marketing community as intentionally viral was Burger
      King&apos;s use of the Subservient Chicken to promote its TenderCrisp chicken strips. The website featured a
      costumed chicken character responding to typed commands. The idea was to connect viewers&apos; actions to Burger
      King&apos;s tagline, &quot;Have it your way.&quot; A &quot;tell a friend&quot; button on the site encouraged
      sharing. According to Burger King, the site received more than 46 million hits in the week following its launch in
      April 2004 (Kotler &amp; Armstrong, 2006).</p>

    <p class="tx">While some viral campaigns are carefully planned and executed by marketers, like Burger King&apos;s
      Subservient Chicken, others arise from serendipitous moments. At a Portland, Oregon, rally during Bernie
      Sanders&apos;s presidential campaign in 2016, an unexpected interaction between a small bird and Sanders was
      caught on camera and posted to social media. It generated a $3.7 million windfall in small-dollar donations as
      hashtags like #BernieBird, #BirdieSanders, and #BirdsForBernie quickly spread (Corasaniti, 2016).</p>

    <p class="tx">The stories of Burger King&apos;s Subservient Chicken and #BirdieSanders are reminders that in the
      world of social media, it&apos;s not about marketers communicating messages&#x2014;it&apos;s about providing value
      through entertainment (DeBiase, 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">In the bigger picture of promotional mix strategies, what value does an uncontrollable message channel
      like buzz marketing have? Not only are marketers asking, &quot;Where&apos;s the ROMI?,&quot; they&apos;re worrying
      about what&apos;s at stake when the public takes a message and runs with it.</p>

    <p class="tx">The consensus is that buzz campaigns should tie the entertaining message to something of value that
      produces a measurable result, like use of a coupon. For example, Groupon often requires a minimum number of
      customers for the daily deals to be offered, a strategy intended to encourage people to share the offers with
      their friends through social media, and that produces tracking data when each groupon is redeemed.</p>

    <p class="tx">Promotions strengthen brands while aiming at a specific tactical objective, such as providing
      information, increasing demand, differentiating a product, highlighting its value, or stabilizing sales.
      Promotional strategies (which may be personal or nonpersonal and may employ a push or pull tactic) require
      selecting a promotional mix, choosing from message channels in four categories. The paid and owned categories are
      brand controlled, while the earned and shared categories are stakeholder controlled. As marketers adjust to a
      world in which consumers trust their peers more than advertisers, their promotional mix selections are trending
      toward direct marketing and social media, while depending less on traditional advertising media. However, they are
      wrestling with two issues: how to measure results and how to manage the loss of control inherent in the
      consumer-generated conversations in earned and shared media channels.</p>

    <a id="p201"></a>
    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">The #BirdieSanders episode, while it provided comic relief and clear differentiation of the
        candidate, highlights marketers&apos; concern about lack of control over buzz marketing. Are marketers better
        off using brand-controlled (paid or owned channels) to avoid the loss of control associated with
        stakeholder-controlled (earned or shared) channels?</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec6.3">6.3&#x2002;Promotional Mix Decisions</h1>
    <p class="tx">Promotional mix decisions involve (a) choosing the right message channel to reach target customers and
      (b) developing the right message to send them. To do this, marketers need an understanding of
      communications&#x2014;how messages get from a sender to a receiver and what occurs as a result.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.3.1">Frameworks for Understanding Communications</h2>
    <p class="tx">In the communication process, senders encode messages in language, media carry the messages, and
      receivers decode the language of the messages. Consider the following text message exchange:</p>

    <p class="ext">Joe: 2b,cafe 9.</p>

    <p class="ext">Selena: I b l8.</p>

    <p class="ext">Joe: NP.</p>

    <p class="tx">Joe is telling Selena he&apos;ll be at the caf&#xE9; at 9; she responds that she&apos;ll be tardy in
      joining him, and he replies &quot;no problem.&quot; The exchange has been encoded in the shorthand of text
      messaging and sent through the medium of wireless cell phone communications.</p>

    <p class="tx">With the growth of interactive media channels, almost everyone has the ability to create as well as to
      receive messages. Thus, we interact in a <strong>transactional communication model</strong>. The transaction
      occurs when the receiver responds by encoding another message and sending it through media, and the original
      sender decodes its language, as in Joe and Selena&apos;s exchange.</p>

    <a id="p202"></a>
    <p class="tx">Several factors can keep the transaction from being as clearly understood as Joe and Selena&apos;s
      text conversation. Extraneous <strong>noise</strong> factors can distort or block the message. Noise could be a
      typo in a text message or a badly printed page in a newspaper that makes an advertisement difficult to read. In
      spoken communication, noise can be actual background sounds or an individual&apos;s accent or use of slang that
      make it difficult for the hearer to decode what was said. Noise results in the receiver getting a different
      message from the one the sender intended&#x2014;or receiving no message at all.</p>

    <p class="tx">In addition to the unplanned distortion caused by noise, a lack of shared experience can hamper
      communication transactions. Marketing communicators must understand their target consumers&apos; <strong>field of
        experience</strong>. Each of us has a field of experience, made up of the attitudes, knowledge, perceptions, and
      values that we bring to a situation. Effective communication can only take place when sender and receiver share a
      field of experience that allows each to understand what the other is talking about. When an American mentions
      wearing knickers to ski, a Briton will picture the skier wearing only underpants&#x2014;an example of
      miscommunication through a lack of shared field of experience regarding the meaning of the word <em>knickers</em>.
      If Joe and Selena did not share the same field of experience regarding text message abbreviations, they could have
      unintentionally blown their date.</p>

    <p class="tx">For marketers to craft effective messages and place them in effective channels, they must understand
      the importance of the transactional communication model. In a Marketing 3.0 world, customers expect to have
      conversations with the companies they buy from. And with the increasing globalization of that 3.0 world, attention
      to the target audience&apos;s field of experience grows more important.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.3.2">Plans, Schedules, and Budgets</h2>
    <p class="tx">With an understanding of the target audience&apos;s field of experience and the transactional
      communication model, marketers have the information on which to base effective promotional mix decisions. Now we
      turn our attention to exactly what those decisions involve: plans, schedules, and budgets.</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Plans</em> are essential for effective action. Factors affecting the plan for the promotional mix
      include the following:</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><em>Type of market:</em> Small audience concentrated in one geographic area, or large market,
        scattered over large or distributed geographic area(s).</li>

      <li class="bl">
        <em>Type of product offering:</em> Convenience, shopping, specialty, or unsought (defined in Chapter 3).</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Seasonality:</em> Offerings that experience cyclical changes in demand.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Stage in the product life cycle</em> (defined in Chapter 3): Introduction acquaints consumers
        or intermediaries with a new offering; growth calls for advertising to increase interest; maturity requires
        messages that stress differentiating attributes; decline sees a shift to sales promotions or reduced spending.
      </li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Business model/channel strategy:</em> B2C organizations tend to use pull strategies, while B2B
        tend to use push strategies (defined in Chapter 4).</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Budget: </em>The cost of paid and owned channels, plus the cost of monitoring and participating
        in shared and earned channels.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Competitors:</em> Businesses facing new or aggressive competitors respond by increasing
        promotional activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">These factors will lead marketing decision makers toward either a personal approach or a nonpersonal
      one. Personal selling tends to dominate when the number of buyers is small, their geography is reasonably
      concentrated, and the offering is complex or requires customization. Nonpersonal selling dominates when a large
      number of buyers are so widely dispersed that they are difficult to service personally and/or when the offering is
      standardized, with minimal need for service during or after the sale (Kurtz, 2010). Table 6.3 highlights unique
      features of several message channels.</p>

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. Each message channel has its advantages and disadvantages; marketers make
      their selection based on promotional objectives.</p>

    <p class="tx">A promotional objective can be achieved with many combinations of message channels. Planning a
      successful promotional mix schedule requires creativity and insight into the target market&apos;s interest and
      purchasing behavior (Kerin, Hartley, &amp; Rudelius, 2009).</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Schedules</em> must be developed for every activity in the promotional plan. A <em>media plan</em>
      is developed for all paid advertising; this topic is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. The media plan details
      the when, where, how much, and what (message content) intended for each media outlet. More schedules cover
      personal selling and public relations activities, sales promotions, and direct marketing campaigns, if called for,
      in the promotional mix.</p>

    <p class="tx">An organization can only execute what it can pay for, so <em>budgets</em> come into play for each
      activity in the promotional mix. A number of methods of budgeting have their proponents; the task-objective
      approach is one that emphasizes measurement of the productivity of each promotional dollar (Kurtz, 2010). In this
      method (discussed in more detail in Chapter 9), marketers determine specific promotional objectives and then
      determine the amount and type of spending needed to achieve them. Computer-based modeling helps planners explore
      what-if scenarios to estimate the effect of various levels of spending.</p>

    <a id="p204"></a>
    <p class="tx">Measurement of results quantifies the program&apos;s contribution to profitability, or ROMI. Typical
      measures include cost per impression, cost per response or click-through, and conversion rate (how many receivers
      of the message convert from prospect to customer). Calculating ROMI is also described in Chapter 9.</p>

    <p class="tx">In the hyperengaged world of Marketing 3.0, marketers must analyze and measure both outgoing and
      incoming communication. Campaigns that integrate some form of direct response make it much easier to quantify
      results, but marketers are still seeking ways to measure the contribution to profits from brand narratives
      generated in social media conversations. Budgets are easier to justify when the effect of the spending can be
      quantified.</p>

    <p class="tx">The promotional mix, when strategically designed, brings news of goods and services that improve lives
      to the people most likely to benefit from them. Accurate targeting keeps that news from cluttering the worlds of
      those who are not interested, and creativity in designing the message delivers the value of entertainment, as
      evidenced by campaigns that go viral.</p>

    <p class="tx">None of this would take place without an understanding of communications applied to the promotional
      mix&#x2014;or without marketers&apos; plans, schedules, and budgets.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">With the increasing use of message channels controlled by stakeholders, including consumers and
        commentators, conventional measurement methodology becomes less and less relevant. How do you think
        stakeholders&apos; impact on the brand narrative through social media might be effectively measured?</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec6.4">6.4&#x2002;Crafting Marketing Messages</h1>
    <p class="tx">An effective marketing message does more than simply reach a receiver. It must gain the
      receiver&apos;s attention, achieve an understanding shared by both sender and receiver, call the receiver&apos;s
      attention to felt needs and desires, and suggest how these might be satisfied. That&apos;s a tall order, one that
      requires focus on first selecting an appropriate creative approach, then following up with excellent technical
      execution of the content that will fill message channels.</p>

    <p class="tx">The promotional mix will indicate whether a push or pull tactic will be emphasized, with a goal of
      creating a flow of demand either through messages directed to intermediaries or by advertising to consumers to
      stimulate them to seek out retailers selling the product or service. When push is the tactic, there may be little
      or no advertising to create. The marketing messages will likely take the form of talking points for salespeople to
      use in face-to-face conversation. When pull is the tactic, advertising more often carries the marketing message.
      It&apos;s time to take a closer look at that process.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing messages may be created in-house by an organization&apos;s marketing department or developed
      by the organization&apos;s advertising agency. The roles and processes in creating advertising messages will be
      much the same in either work flow.</p>

    <a id="p205"></a>
    <p class="tx">Each message channel specified in the promotional mix requires content to fill it&#x2014;and therefore
      planning, implementation, and evaluation. In Chapter 2 you learned about the campaign development process.
      Essential to that process is the <strong>creative brief</strong>&#x2014;a document prepared by marketing planners
      that sets out the communication objective, profiles the target audience, and conveys instructions for work to be
      done by the creative team. Market research results will be included in the brief, or in its absence, a description
      of research needed. The brief includes a schedule and deadlines for each step in the creative process. The brief
      puts a framework around the process that gives direction and supports an approvals process as creative work is
      completed.</p>

    <p class="tx">Who are the people on the creative team? Roles are shifting dramatically under the influence of media
      convergence and consumer collaboration. Traditional roles of account manager and account planner may evolve to new
      roles with titles like idea architect, data miner, and delivery wizard (Cassel, Gross, Mahoney, &amp; Monahan,
      2011). Working under these leaders&apos; direction, content producers such as writers, artists, videographers, and
      web designers collaborate to produce messages.</p>

    <p class="tx">In addition to the creative team, a marketing department or ad agency will include strategic planners,
      media planners, and a traffic controller whose responsibility is to assign work, monitor progress, and ensure that
      all the components of a marketing campaign come together as planned. Researchers may be on staff, dedicated to
      profiling target markets, evaluating marketing campaigns&apos; effects, and feeding that information back to
      managers and planners.</p>

    <p class="tx">It&apos;s time for a closer look at the components that drive advertising strategy, the subset of the
      promotional mix that deals with paid media.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.4.1">Advertising Strategies</h2>
    <p class="tx">The creative brief includes a statement of advertising strategy that sums up <em>who</em> is targeted,
      <em>what</em> benefit will lead the pitch, and <em>why</em>&#x2014;the rationale that supports the claimed
      benefit. The advertising strategy gets its direction from the brand&apos;s positioning and the value proposition
      marketing decision makers have developed. The brief also specifies whether the marketing message will include a
      specific call to action&#x2014;termed <strong>direct response advertising</strong>&#x2014;or will focus on
      creating generalized goodwill for a product, service, idea, or organization&#x2014;termed <strong>image
        advertising</strong>. Image advertising evokes a scene that associates pleasure with the offering. Image
      advertising works slowly over time, building brand equity. Campaigns like General Electric&apos;s &quot;We bring
      good things to life&quot; or Intel Corporation&apos;s &quot;Intel Inside&quot; are examples of image advertising.

      </p>
    </div>

    <a id="p206"></a>
    <p class="tx">Companies seeking measurable short-term results deploy direct response advertising, which asks for the
      order with phrases like &quot;Vote on Tuesday&quot; or &quot;Call in the next hour to receive an extra
      bonus.&quot; Direct response advertising often makes use of sales promotional techniques, as described in Chapter
      5. These techniques, which add short-term incentives to buy that are not part of the value proposition of the
      service rendered, give urgency to the call to action in direct response ads.</p>




    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.4.2">Developing the Creative Approach</h2>


    <p class="tx">Ads sell by dramatizing a value proposition. Words and images bring the offering to life in a manner
      consistent with a company&apos;s brand. With an audience and a value proposition in mind, the creative team
      approaches the task of finding a &quot;big idea&quot;&#x2014;a memorable narrative that dramatizes the value
      proposition.</p>

    <p class="tx">As advertising professionals adapt to the Marketing 3.0 world of consumers engaged in creating their
      own brand narratives, more big ideas are coming from customers who relate the stories of their experiences with a
      brand. A creative revolution is taking place as marketers seek creative responses that keep their brands at the
      center of consumers&apos; hearts and minds. The fundamentals of developing a creative approach remain in place,
      but what creative advertising minds build on that foundation is taking bold new directions (Hackley, 2010).</p>

    <p class="tx">Even so, certain fundamentals of effective advertising remain. Advertising copy follows a precise
      structure, as formulaic as a sonnet or haiku. The structure is termed the <strong>AIDA formula</strong>, an
      acronym that describes four common requirements to sell a product or service. The seller must</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">get <strong>A</strong>ttention,</li>
      <li class="nl">arouse <strong>I</strong>nterest,</li>
      <li class="nl">create <strong>D</strong>esire, and</li>
      <li class="nl">motivate <strong>A</strong>ction.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="tx">Advertising copywriters generally begin by developing a concept, represented by either an image or a
      headline that will command the attention of a target market. They then write copy that includes points designed to
      provoke the four requirements of AIDA in the correct sequence.</p>

    <p class="tx">Most ads contain both informational and persuasive elements. Common advertising creative approaches
      include the following:</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><em>Storytelling: </em>Describes the experience of the product in use.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Number of reasons why:</em> Presents the value proposition as a series of feature/benefit
        statements, typically ranked in order of priority.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Question and answer:</em> Similar to number of reasons why; presents the value proposition in a
        series of questions and answers, often scripted as a conversation.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Humor:</em> Uses exaggerations or incongruities to blend entertainment with the selling
        message.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Fear:</em> Suggests negative consequences that can be avoided through the value proposition.
      </li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Sex appeal: </em>Suggests increased attractiveness will be achieved through the value
        proposition.</li>
    </ul>

    <a id="p207"></a>
    <div class="box-2">
      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 6.6: </strong><em>Crafting Image Advertising</em></h1>
      <p class="tx">While the objective of a direct response ad is to trigger an action that leads to a sale, the
        objective of image advertising is to slowly build a specific brand identity and narrative.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="tx">When advertising copy is destined for one-to-one marketing, opportunities for customization are woven
      in. Data should drive increased relevancy in the copy and imagery for each recipient. Developing ads destined for
      multiple versions is a demanding specialty.</p>

    <p class="tx">It is not uncommon for creative professionals to push the boundaries of the creative brief. A big idea
      might bubble up that dramatizes a different benefit than specified by the brief. A fresh idea for imagery or a
      headline might feel so promising that the creative team goes back to the planners to suggest that the creative
      brief be altered to fit the idea. Like any creative process, developing great advertising must leave room for
      discovery.</p>

    <p class="tx">The goal of every advertising message is <strong>engagement</strong>. Ads that entertain earn that
      engagement by delivering a small, pleasurable experience. <strong><em>Advertainment</em></strong> is a term coined
      for ads that entertain by relating a dramatic narrative or by engaging consumers in an interaction, such as a
      game. The goal with this type of content is to become widely talked about, shared, and viewed. Advertainment
      merges the marketing brand-controlled channels of advertising and sponsorship with the stakeholder-controlled
      channels of social media. Advertainment can be achieved with &quot;old-style&quot; advertisements that entertain
      so well that people want to share them, like commercials for Levi&apos;s 501 jeans, or by interactive techniques
      like Burger King&apos;s Subservient Chicken.</p>

    <p class="tx">Ads that simply help people feel a human connection can generate engagement just as effectively as
      advertainment can. Betting that tears can feel as good as a laugh in the right situation, Kimberly-Clark launched
      an ad campaign with the tagline &quot;someone needs one&quot; in 2015. It featured people helping others in
      emotional distress. In one television commercial, a boy offers a Kleenex to a girl on the school bus who appears
      to have been bullied. The ads are part of a larger campaign that includes Facebook ads targeted to specific
      demographics. The initiative, designed to use heightened emotions to raise the product above commodity status,
      were measured based on iSpot.tv effectiveness rating, a measure of the ratio of social media mentions to estimated
      dollars spent. During the first 4 days of its run, the campaign earned a 9.2 rating, well above the 5.4 average
      for the personal care products industry (Neff, 2015).</p>

      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 6.7: </strong><em>Advertising that Entertains</em></h1>
      <p class="tx">Engaging with advertising online&#x2014;for example, by clicking a &quot;share&quot;
        button&#x2014;is easy. But interacting with traditional print media is possible too, as proved by an innovative

    <p class="tx">As you have learned, marketing messages more often support a pull strategy than a push strategy. The
      messages follow the AIDA structure designed to move recipients from unawareness to a measurable action. Any of
      several creative approaches may be used to communicate the value proposition. The goal is to achieve engagement
      with potential buyers in the target market, in a manner consistent with the seller&apos;s brand.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="tx">Strategic decisions about the promotional mix are complex and mission critical for even the smallest
      start-up firm and the decades-old mom-and-pop business. But now the Marketing 3.0 landscape invites businesses to
      increase their reach into international markets, as discussed in Chapter 1. Global marketing puts a new spin on
      every aspect of the marketing mix, not to mention the socioeconomic and legal requirements of all the countries
      and markets involved. Let&apos;s examine strategies for global markets.</p>

    <p class="tx">Developing a global marketing program begins with choosing a communication strategy, which may involve
      extension, adaptation, or innovation.</p>

    <a id="p209"></a>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">
        Extension: With the extension strategy, brand communications are introduced into new markets around the world by
        extending a promotional strategy used in the home market. This affords deep cost savings in creating marketing
        campaigns and leads to greater coherence in the brand narrative. Products like Coca-Cola&apos;s family of
        beverages and Unilever&apos;s Organics shampoo line have had success with this strategy. However, many brands
        have found that consumers&apos; tastes are not the same around the world, limiting the utility of this approach
        (Hollensen, 2007). </li>
      <li class="bl">
        Adaptation: In this strategy, the brand keeps the offering(s) for the new market fundamentally unchanged but
        alters the promotional program to reflect cultural differences in foreign markets. Sometimes, however, the
        product as well must be altered to maintain its functionality in different locales. For example, gauges must
        reflect the system of measures used (metric or English), and electrical appliances must be modified to work with
        the different electrical voltages in different countries. </li>
      <li class="bl">
        Innovation: Sometimes a company&apos;s existing products are not an ideal fit for the target country, in which
        case a strategic decision to enter a foreign market brings with it a need not just for a promotional strategy
        but for product innovation as well. In such a case, a company should look for a product idea that fits within
        its existing brand narrative. After Vicks successfully entered the Indian market with its existing products, it
        created additional all-natural herbal products, developed with the aid of ancient Sanskrit texts (Das, 2008).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.5.1">Viewing Global Strategy Through the Lens of the Four Ps </h2>
    <p class="tx">The strategies driving all four of the Ps of the marketing mix should be evaluated when a company
      plans to market its products and services around the world.</p>

    <p class="tx">Product/service offerings are not created equally in terms of their promise for a global marketing
      program. Theoretically, the same fundamental consumer segments exist worldwide and therefore can be met by a
      company with a global orientation. In practice, the promise of worldwide consumer appeal is directly related to
      how <strong>culturally bound</strong> a product is. The more culturally unbound a product is, the more likely it
      can be marketed worldwide, as the global popularity of Coca-Cola and Pepsi demonstrate. On the other hand, until
      the explosion of interest in quinoa as a health food in the United States, the Andean seed would have been
      considered a culturally bound product, for which little demand existed outside its home country. Products used in
      the home, like soups and frozen foods, are frequently more culturally bound than products used outside the home,
      like cars or credit cards. Consumer technology products like personal computers and tablets are among the more
      culturally unbound, because their performance benefits remain the same all over the world (Aliber &amp; Click,
      1993).</p>

    <p class="tx">Pricing strategy reflects the value customers place on an offering, which naturally differs in every
      marketplace and consumer segment. The cost structure that determines an offering&apos;s breakeven point is
      affected by the strategy chosen to enter a foreign market&#x2014;a joint venture will have different implications
      than a simple export agreement, for example. International pricing decisions are made within a framework of
      internal and external factors. Internal factors include corporate and marketing objectives, market entry modes,
      and product factors like stage in the product life cycle and fit of the current brand narrative to the chosen
      foreign market. External factors include governmental constraints; currency fluctuations; degree of development of
      the chosen market (industrialized, emerging, or preindustrial); and market factors such as customers&apos;
      perceptions, ability to pay, and the presence of competitors.</p>

    <a id="p210"></a>
    <p class="tx">From these internal and external factors, the price level for introductory pricing, the decision
      whether to standardize prices across countries or allow differentiation, and the terms of sale and payment can be
      determined (Hollensen, 2007). When Vicks entered the market in rural India, it created new sizes and price points
      for its products adapted to the buying power of the Indian poor. The company cultivated native distribution
      networks rather than building its own (Das, 2008).</p>

    <p class="tx">Which brings us to distribution strategies for global markets, which were touched on in Chapter 4.
      Pursuing global strategies adds complexity to supply chains. Design of those supply chains should be made with the
      final consumer in mind, the keystone of all marketing decisions. Thus, marketers must consider the shopping
      habits, usage patterns, and geographic density of consumers in the chosen market. These factors vary from country
      to country and reflect sociocultural factors (Hollensen, 2007). Many companies find that they need to delegate
      distribution activities to local subsidiaries but struggle with giving up control. When going global, marketers
      have a broad range of alternatives for selecting and developing international distribution channels, which are
      beyond the scope of this discussion.</p>

    <p class="tx">Promotional strategy in international markets must reflect an offering&apos;s stage in the product
      life cycle, just as it must in the home market. As you learned in Chapter 3, every product has a life span,
      progressing through the four phases of introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. The product&apos;s stage
      impacts (but does not dictate) selection of a promotional strategy. Complicating that decision process, many firms
      offer multiple product or service lines, some of which are &quot;older&quot; and some &quot;younger&quot; in terms
      of their life cycles. The time it takes for a product to pass through a stage likely varies from market to market
      internationally (Hollensen, 2007). Both the product and the promotion strategy likely need to be adapted to suit
      the product&apos;s life cycle stage in each target country.</p>

    <p class="tx">But perhaps the biggest challenge in promotional strategy is the imperative to develop flexible
      campaigns in which marketing assets can be deployed many times, across different markets&#x2014;exponentially
      increasing the challenge of IMC (Freedman, 2014). At minimum, campaign materials must be translated into each
      foreign market language. Reaching customers in a way that creates true engagement, and not just a transactional
      communication loop, is the goal of global promotional strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx">In sum, what do we see when we view global marketing programs through the lens of the four Ps? A need
      to adapt the marketing mix, especially where culturally bound products are concerned.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.5.2">A Global Marketing Program in Action: Oreos in China</h2>
    <p class="tx">The experience of Kraft Foods in marketing Oreos in China reveals how these marketing mix factors come
      together in a global marketing program. When Kraft Foods tried to introduce Oreos in China in 1996, it extended
      its U.S. communications strategy and product into the new foreign marketplace, where it turned out to have little
      appeal. Then in 2005 the company shifted to an adaptation strategy. Chinese consumers thought the U.S. version of
      the Oreo was too sweet, so Kraft developed a new flavor profile. Chinese consumers also objected to the shape of
      the cookie. The Chinese love wafer cookies, so in 2006 Kraft launched a rectangular Oreo wafer cookie with the
      familiar cr&#xE8;me filling but coated in chocolate. It subsequently earned 30% of the wafer cookie market.
      &quot;More than anything else, it&apos;s been Oreo&apos;s willingness to alter its size, shape and flavor that led
      to its dominance of the Chinese cookie market,&quot; writes Jeff Beier (2012, para. 13) in <em>Canadian
        Business</em>.</p>

    <a id="p211"></a>
    <p class="tx">Kraft (renamed Mondelez International in 2011) also found that the traditional Oreo package was too
      big for Chinese pocketbooks and distribution channels. A smaller size worked better in small mom-and-pop groceries
      and could be priced to suit consumers with less disposable income.</p>

    <p class="tx">For its promotions, the company switched from simply subtitling its American commercials to a creative
      approach designed specifically for the Chinese market. Commercials focused on children (in Chinese culture, the
      center of the family) and used locally popular spokespeople like former NBA star Yao Ming. These shifts in the
      marketing mix helped Oreo grow its market share by 10 times over the next 5 years (Beier, 2012).</p>

    <p class="tx">It should be clear from this example how the four Ps of the marketing mix interact in global marketing
      programs.</p>

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec6.6">6.6&#x2002;Promotional Mix Issues in a Marketing 3.0 World</h1>
    <p class="tx">In the consumer-empowered world of Marketing 3.0, marketers no longer control all aspects of the
      promotional mix&#x2014;only the paid and owned channels. Stakeholders&#x2014;especially customers&#x2014;control
      the earned and shared channels. They expect to be partners, turning their urge for meaningful engagement into
      collaboration with the companies they buy from (Prahad &amp; Krishnan, 2008). This shift has affected the
      promotions aspect of the marketing mix, demanding tighter cross-functional control, strategic use of consumer
      data, attention to social responsibility, and care in addressing foreign markets.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.6.1">Tighter Cross-Functional Control</h2>
    <p class="tx">As should now be clear, the topic of promotions represents a complex web of activities that include
      selecting, managing, and measuring a brand strategy; bringing customers into conversation with the brand via the
      four types of message channels; and coordinating marketing messages for each channel so that members of the target
      audience receive a coherent, consistent impression across all message channels. Therefore, it is essential to have
      cross-functional coordination, both internal to the organization and with external partners such as ad agencies,
      media buying firms, and data providers. This coordination requires a market orientation, which by now you know
      means an unwavering focus on the consumer&apos;s experience. Because managing this complexity is so essential,
      marketers increasingly work within a framework IMC to integrate all management initiatives related to brand
      communications. We&apos;ll examine the IMC approach in Chapter 9.</p>

    <a id="p212"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.6.2">Practicing One-to-One Direct Marketing</h2>
    <p class="tx">The growth of direct marketing parallels the move toward IMC: Both respond to changes in media
      channels, growth in customized products, and increasing use of database technology to target campaigns to niche
      markets (Kotler &amp; Armstrong, 2006).</p>

    <p class="tx">Increasing technological power for data-driven marketing has given rise to the use of analytics to
      understand customer behavior, with the goal of reaching the right people with the right offer at just the right
      moment. Whether the promotional technique involves direct mail, e-mail, or some other channel, the advantage of
      one-to-one marketing is the ability to track what happens after asking for the sale, which provides data that can
      lead to improved strategies and better results with every cycle. This technology has given rise to the field of
      <strong>customer analytics</strong>&#x2014;a specialized decision-support approach that influences market
      segmentation and makes possible <strong>predictive analytics</strong>, the use of current and historical facts to
      make predictions about future events. But the need to acquire and track huge amounts of data poses a new
      challenge: developing effective <strong>data mining</strong> techniques to analyze and make predictions about
      consumer behavior, feed new product development, and create ongoing relationships with individuals. How to mine
      the data so it produces useful information and insights? Marketers are still working toward an effective answer.
      More on this topic appears in Chapter 7.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.6.3">Social Responsibility</h2>
    <p class="tx">As marketers increase their reliance on information technology, issues of social responsibility come
      into play. Privacy advocates suggest that devious marketers are intent on learning about consumers without their
      knowledge. They question the ethics of <strong>behavioral targeting</strong>, by which marketers capture
      consumers&apos; communication behaviors and then market to them based on those observations. Many marketing
      practitioners see this as merely the latest evolution of the database marketing that has been common practice for
      half a century. Professor emeritus Don Schultz (2011a) characterized the two prevailing views of this ethical
      question in his article &quot;The Bugaboo of Behaviors&quot; in the summer 2011 issue of <em>Marketing
      </em><em>Management</em>:</p>

    <p class="ext">&quot;It&apos;s insidious snooping and invasion of personal activities,&quot; say the privacy
      advocates.</p>

    <p class="ext">&quot;It&apos;s useful and helpful analysis to provide better coordinated and more relevant marketing
      for consumers,&quot; say the practitioners.</p>

    <a id="p213"></a>
    <p class="ext">The problem is that both are likely right. (p. 10)</p>

    <p class="tx">Schultz (2011a) concludes that there is no need for surreptitious use of electronic data&#x2014;that
      simple statistical analysis of reliable data that consumers willingly provide is enough to improve marketing
      returns. Industry-developed guidelines call for adherence to a set of consumer privacy rules that includes
      honoring consumer requests to opt out of receiving marketing messages and/or dissemination of their contact
      information to other marketers (Kotler &amp; Armstrong, 2006).</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers must accept responsibility for observing laws against false and deceptive promotional
      practices. Reebok claimed its EasyToneTM shoe line would tone and strengthen customers&apos; legs 11% better and
      sculpt bottoms 28% better than regular walking shoes. The Federal Trade Commission&apos;s (FTC) Bureau of Consumer
      Protection disagreed. Reebok settled with the F<sup>TC </sup>to avoid a protracted legal battle (Elliott, 2011e).
      Customers who bought the shoes and filed their claims by the deadline of April 10, 2012, received up to $25
      million in refunds (Bumgardner, 2016).</p>
    <p class="tx">Consumers&apos; concerns about intrusive advertising, invasion of privacy, and the nuisance of spam
      are all valid. Marketers who engage in such practices risk damage to their brands, if not actual legal sanctions.
      Socially responsible marketing builds bonds of loyalty, not mistrust. More on socially responsible marketing
      appears in Chapter 10.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec6.6.4">Issues in Global Promotions</h2>
    <p class="tx">Globalization is widely viewed as an imperative driving business strategy today (Douglas &amp; Craig,
      2011). But the trend toward direct and consumer-generated marketing techniques meets difficulty when exported
      beyond developed countries where a consumer culture dominates. These techniques, so effective with Marketing 3.0
      consumers, are not well supported globally. Delivering messages by Internet, mail, or phone is not as reliable in
      developing countries. International mailing lists are increasingly hard to come by, due to international magazines
      ceasing print distribution, which reduces the number of subscriber lists available. Some countries require
      mandatory opt-in to marketing messages. Systems for secure payment are not equally available around the globe
      (Kerin et al., 2009). Advertising messages, websites, and so on must be translated into the languages of each
      country entered or leave significant revenue on the table. More than 50% of online consumers across three
      continents surveyed by Common Sense Advisory in 2006 indicated they were willing to pay a higher price if given
      information in their own language (Kelly, 2006). In light of these factors, going global loses its luster.</p>

    <p class="tx">The possibility of cultural missteps rises as the common ground between sellers and buyers is reduced.
      The lack of shared language and heritage makes it difficult for a creative team from one culture to create pitches
      that resonate with consumers in another culture. For example, the &quot;OK&quot; sign made with thumb and first
      finger in the United States translates in Mediterranean countries as &quot;zero&quot; or &quot;the worst&quot; and
      in Tunisia as &quot;I&apos;ll kill you&quot; (Kurtz, 2010). An ad featuring that familiar image would send a very
      different message in different countries. Furthermore, ethical issues like the quinoa conundrum discussed in
      Chapter 1 fuel consumer anxiety about the cultural effects of globalization. A backlash against brands may result.
    </p>

    <a id="p214"></a>
    <p class="tx">Consider the experience of Starbucks in China, where the Seattle-born coffee giant declared its
      intentions to open 500 stores a year. Like Kraft Foods in the Oreos example, Starbucks was drawn by the sheer size
      of the consumer population in China. Starbucks built its relationships with Chinese consumers through the
      &quot;owned&quot; channel of its own socially responsible operations. Starbucks invested in high wages and
      generous benefits, including ownership options, housing allowances, and health care benefits for its Chinese
      workforce&#x2014;expecting the ROI to come in the form of authentically positive word of mouth.</p>

    <p class="tx">The company also invested in producing coffee in China&apos;s Yunnan Province, creating hundreds of
      jobs in the process. The parent company operates Starbucks China as an autonomous business unit managed by a team
      of both Chinese and U.S. executives, headed by a Chinese CEO. Together, these moves brought it closer to its
      customers, minimizing globalization concerns and the potential for cultural missteps.</p>

    <p class="tx">So, what is the bottom line? When it comes to global promotional strategies, applying a
      one-size-fits-all creative approach is seldom effective. Leading strategists recommend integrating marketing
      communications activity in all parts of the world but respecting the different strategic directions required in
      different parts of the globe (Douglas &amp; Craig, 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">As this discussion has shown, if foreign markets are involved, the complexity of the promotions P of
      the marketing mix in the Marketing 3.0 world demands greater integration of the marketing function, more
      sophisticated use of consumer data, greater attention to social responsibility, and adaptation of communication
      strategy, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Of the issues raised regarding developing promotions in a Marketing 3.0 world, does one issue strike
        you as more important than the others? If yes, why?</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="Case-Study h2" id="ch06casestudy"><strong>Case Study: </strong><em>Barilla&apos;s &quot;Share the
        Table&quot;</em></h2>

    <p class="tx">Italian food company Barilla entered the U.S. market in 1996 and just 3 years later stood first in
      sales among leading brands. When the Atkins diet counseled dieters to radically cut their intake of
      carbohydrate-laden pasta, Barilla fought back by cosponsoring a conference in 2003 that brought the world&apos;s
      top food and nutrition scientists to Rome to discuss (and publicize) the benefits of the Mediterranean diet (Cox,
      2003). Sales continued to improve year-over-year despite the Atkins trend.</p>

    <p class="tx">In 2004 the company launched Academia Barilla, an international project devoted to preserving and
      promoting regional Italian gastronomic culture, and in 2009 added the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, a
      multidisciplinary research program with a mission to better understand and share knowledge about sustainability of
      its food chain (Barilla Group, 2018). These developments give evidence of Barilla&apos;s bona fides as a socially
      responsible company.</p>

    <a id="p215"></a>
    <p class="tx">In 2009 Barilla began to build an integrated marketing campaign designed to link the benefits of the
      Mediterranean diet to a cause-related marketing approach. The company partnered with StrategyOne, the research
      unit of its public relations firm, the Edelman Company, to commission a study on the benefits of families dining
      together. The result was a white paper authored by Dr. William Doherty, director of the Marriage and Family
      Therapy Program at the University of Minnesota and professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community
      Health. Doherty described the study&apos;s conclusion: &quot;These findings tell us that something as simple as
      everyone sitting down together and talking about their day over a good meal can strengthen the bonds between
      parents and kids&quot; (as cited in Barilla Group, 2011, para. 5).</p>

    <p class="tx">In 2010 Barilla was ready to make that good news the centerpiece of an initiative it named Share the
      Table: The Family Dinner Project. With a goal of building brand equity, the company rolled out a public relations
      campaign and a website, SharetheTable.com. Its strategy to achieve that goal was simply to make a strong emotional
      connection with its consumers. Barilla set out to become the brand consumers turned to at family dinnertime. The
      positioning was a good fit for the brand&apos;s DNA. &quot;We&apos;re also Italian&#x2014;we don&apos;t believe
      that food is just functional, but that food is about togetherness&quot; (Bucci, 2011, para. 7), said Prita
      Wadhwani, marketing manager, integrated marketing at Barilla, in a 2011 interview.</p>

    <p class="tx">The integrated marketing campaign featured celebrity spokespeople, including chef Mario Batali plus
      actress Julianne Moore and country singer Martina McBride (who were moms). The website offered recipes, tips for
      enhancing the family dinner experience, and a downloadable cookbook. <em>Family Circle</em> magazine signed on as
      the campaign&apos;s media sponsor, having been a partner in the original research project. Over 1,000 paid ad
      placements supported the public relations and digital elements of the campaign. The integrated effort earned 187
      (unpaid) media mentions, including national radio, TV, and print coverage, plus publicity in 3 of the top 20 food
      blogs at the time. What made the campaign successful, according to Wadhwani, was its 360-degree approach: blending
      all the tools in the marketers toolbox, teaming with a media partner, and providing tools and tips that supported
      its cause-related message of family well-being. In 2011 the campaign received the Grand Prize from the Bulldog
      Awards for Excellence in Media Relations and Publicity (Bucci, 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">But that&apos;s not the end of the story. Over the next years, Barilla turned to other campaign
      strategies, including its 2011 Summer of Italy campaign that combined experiential marketing with sales promotion,
      building its chops at integrated marketing communications (Newman, 2011d). It continued to host the Share the
      Table website and sponsor celebrity spokespeople on the campaign&apos;s behalf.</p>

    <p class="tx">Then in September 2013 Barilla&apos;s CEO made an antigay comment on a regional Italian radio station.
      He said he would never feature a gay family in Barilla&apos;s advertising, which typically showed a mother serving
      pasta to her family. He was quickly savaged on social media, staining the Barilla brand. Offended consumers set
      Facebook and Twitter afire, while rival brands posted messages about their own inclusiveness (Reuters, 2013).</p>

    <p class="tx">Barilla responded by doubling down on its Share the Table campaign. The early 2014 iteration of the
      campaign featured more content on the website, including tips from Doherty (author of the original research) and
      activities for children; a social media&#x2013;ready video featuring children sharing why mealtime is important; a
      customer advisory panel; partnerships with food bloggers; and a new cause-related element&#x2014;a donation to
      Meals on Wheels for every social media post featuring a family at the dinner table and the #SharetheTable hashtag
      during a specified period (Barilla Group, 2014).</p>

    <a id="p216"></a>
    <p class="tx">Importantly, the company reached out to gay bloggers. One such blogger, Brent Almond (2014), posted
      about his reaction to Barilla&apos;s outreach:</p>

    <p class="ext">According to the materials I was given and my own research, Barilla has been making changes ever
      since the interview and subsequent boycott. They met with and received counsel from GLAAD; established a Diversity
      &amp; Inclusion Board and appointed a Chief Diversity Officer. . . . If Barilla is sincere in their efforts to not
      just be diverse for the sake of diversity, but to truly &quot;share their table&quot; with any and all kinds of
      families, then I&apos;m willing to hear them out and even help spread the message of communication, togetherness
      and family. (para. 5)</p>

    <p class="tx">Barilla was on the way to recovering from its misstep. Share the Table 2014 won a Platinum Award in
      the Marketing Communication category from PR News in 2015 (Goldstein, 2015).</p>

      <p class="tx">Branding is the DNA of promotions, this chapter has stated, but in the 2013 public relations
        &quot;fail&quot; of Barilla, we see that this &quot;DNA&quot; can be a liability as well as an asset, if the
        brand narrative created by consumers becomes out of sync with the company&apos;s vision of its brand. Several
        lessons can be drawn from the Barilla CEO&apos;s misfire, among them that no one speaking for the brand should
        ever go off-message, no matter how obscure the media channel, and that companies must be prepared at all times
        for a potential crisis in communications. What other lessons might you draw from the Barilla episode in 2013?

    <br>
    <h2 class="eoc-h2" id="ch06keyideas">Key Ideas to Remember</h2>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">
        Branding takes place through a collaboration of consumers and marketers. Consumers contribute to the brand
        narrative through social media conversations in which both positive and negative opinions are expressed.
        Marketers contribute positioning strategy expressed through promotional campaigns and measurement of brand
        performance, and they join the conversation with consumers in which consumers provide the feedback necessary to
        keep the brand narrative aligned with promotional objectives.</li>
      <li class="bl">
        The message channels in the promotional mix can be classified in terms of their ownership and control. Chief
        among the paid, brand-controlled channels are advertising, direct marketing, and sales promotion. Owned,
        brand-controlled channels include company publications, such as a website and blog, and personal selling, such
        as in-store and experiential marketing. Earned, stakeholder-controlled channels include media coverage,
        buzz/word of mouth, and review sites. Shared, stakeholder-controlled channels include social media platforms
        like Facebook, Twitter, and blogs.</li>
      <li class="bl">
        Plans, schedules, and budgets are three aspects of promotions requiring decisions as part of the promotions mix.
        With these decisions in place, a creative brief can be developed, and the marketing creative team can do its
        work to fulfill promotional objectives.</li>
      <li class="bl">
        Marketing messages will support either a pull or push strategy; advertising tends to be used to pull, while
        personal selling is more commonly used to push a message. Marketing messages usually follow the AIDA structure
        to move recipients toward a measurable action. The creative approach conveys the value proposition identified as
        part of the promotional objective. Strategy, structure, and creative approach are carefully planned to achieve
        engagement with the target market while supporting the brand narrative.</li>
      <li class="bl">
        Tighter cross-functional control is required to deliver a consistent message to target audiences across so many
        message channels. Marketers increasingly use the IMC approach to coordinate all that activity related to
        branding and promotions.</li>
      <li class="bl">
        A firm may choose a communication strategy for its global marketing program that centers on extension of the
        home-market approach, adaptation of the current product and promotional strategy, or innovation (usually
        affecting all four Ps of the marketing mix) to make the offering a better fit for a foreign target market.</li>
      <li class="bl">
        Three issues affecting promotional decisions today are more sophisticated use of consumer data, greater
        attention to social responsibility, and the need for a semiglobal strategy that meaningfully integrates the
        brand&apos;s narrative with the local culture when foreign markets will be approached.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="h1" id="ch07intro">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="tx">In the first chapter of this book, you began building insights into consumer buying behavior. In that
      chapter, your view was framed by the concept of consumers&apos; search for value, expressed as the customer value
      equation. In the second chapter, you built on that knowledge as you learned about the marketing process. You
      learned that insights into consumer behavior are necessary inputs to several steps in that process.</p>
    <p class="tx">Consumer behavior was never far from the discussion as you progressed through the chapters on each of
      the marketing mix decisions (the four Ps). Now you&apos;ve come full circle. Consumer buying (or purchasing)
      behavior is again the focus of study. This time, instead of framing the discussion of consumers in terms of their
      search for value, we&apos;ll discuss how the innate aspects of consumer behavior interact with marketing practice.
      We&apos;ll also look at how marketers leverage knowledge about consumers to generate profits and long-term
      relationships.</p>
    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec7.1">7.1&#x2002;Consumer Purchasing Behavior</h1>
    <p class="tx">Consumers&#x2014;the individuals who buy goods and services for personal or household
      consumption&#x2014;create a mind-boggling market opportunity. More than 7.6 billion people inhabit the planet, and
      all of them consume. In the United States alone, there are over 125 million consumer households with a median 2016
      income of $59,039 (Semega, Fontenot, &amp; Kollar, 2017). That&apos;s a lot of purchasing power.</p>
    <p class="tx">With so many consumer dollars on the move, it&apos;s not hard to see why marketers study purchasing
      behavior. Data on what consumers buy, as well as where and how much, are relatively easy to find in a
      company&apos;s own sales transaction records. But what about the &quot;why&quot; behind the buy? What drives
      consumers&apos; actions?</p>
    <p class="tx">Given the diversity of the population, there is no single answer to that question. Marketers attempt
      to figure out how consumers respond to various marketing efforts&#x2014;stimuli that produce responses, in the
      language of social scientists. Some of those stimuli are under marketers&apos; control, produced by marketing mix
      strategies regarding the four Ps of place, price, product, and promotion. Marketers must also take into account
      the stimuli they cannot influence&#x2014;various environmental, cultural, group, and individual factors influence
      consumer behavior. The sociocultural factors influencing purchasing behavior are summarized in Table 7.1. A closer
      look at each of the four categories follows.</p>

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. Marketers cannot control or even exert influence on most factors
      influencing purchasing behavior, but they need to understand the role these factors play in consumers&apos;
      purchasing behavior.</p>

    <a id="p223"></a>
    <p class="tx">Environmental factors include economic, political, legal, and technological forces that influence
      consumer behavior. It&apos;s not hard to envision the influence environmental factors have on purchasing behavior,
      from the one-click impulse buying made possible by technology to the legal restrictions governing certain types of
      purchases, such as guns, cigarettes, or alcohol. We will explore each of the environmental factors listed in Table
      7.1.</p>
    <p class="tx">Cultural factors exert their influence from an early age, shaping wants and motivations.
      <em>Cul</em><em></em><em>ture</em> consists of learned values, perceptions, needs, and behaviors. Marketers focus
      on cultural shifts that may bring to light new marketing opportunities&#x2014;for example, several hundred million
      more people are projected to be living in midsize cities in developing nations by 2025, where most of the
      population had been rural until recently (Mancini, Namysl, Pardo, &amp; Ramaswamy, 2017). <em>Subcultures</em> are
      groups of people within the larger culture who share life experiences, situations, and values. Most culture shifts
      emerge from subcultures. These can be defined by traits such as race or ethnicity, by <strong>generational
        cohort</strong>, by geographic region, or by social class. A<strong>cohort</strong> is a group whose members
      share a significant experience or have similar characteristics. For example, people born in the same span of years
      belong to a generational cohort. Women who smoke belong to a cohort within the subculture of smokers. Even
      lifestyles can be a strong enough organizing principle to produce a subculture, such as homeschoolers or single
      parents. When a cultural group is large enough to have significant spending power, it often becomes the basis for
      target marketing. The rise in &quot;athleisure wear&quot; of the kind sold by Lululemon and Under Armour, targeted
      to a lifestyle that demands clothing for both exercise and casual use, is an example (Kell, 2016).</p>
    <p class="tx">Group factors influence individual behavior through the desire to belong or conform. One may be an
      official member of a group, aspire to be a member, or simply be influenced by a dominant group. <strong>Reference
        groups</strong> share attitudes, behaviors, beliefs, opinions, preferences, and values that an individual uses
      as the basis for judgment. Members of a college fraternity, for example, might form a reference group for an
      arriving freshman. An individual need not be (or even want to be) a member of a reference group to be influenced
      by it. Likewise, one&apos;s family group has a strong influence on purchasing behavior. Even young children have a
      role in family buying decisions. One&apos;s role and status within a group adds an element of influence, as people
      seek the general esteem of the society around them. People&apos;s purchases often reflect the groups they belong
      to, take cues from, or aspire to join.</p>
    <p class="tx">Individual factors influence buying behavior in terms of the goods and services people seek. These
      individual factors change with shifts in occupation, income or wealth, education, age/life stage, and psychology
      (motivations, perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes), demanding different goods and services to fit those personal
      shifts. A closer look at the psychological factors of emotion and motivation follows in Section 7.2. But first,
      let&apos;s consider how this framework for understanding the factors that influence purchasing behavior is
      evolving as today&apos;s consumer changes.</p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.1.1">Consumers Are Changing</h2>
    <p class="tx">As discussed in other chapters, today&apos;s consumers are unlike consumers 50 or even 25 years ago in
      many ways. For one, today&apos;s consumers are active participants in the marketing process. They influence each
      other by sharing opinions and experiences and expect to have input into customizing products&#x2014;even,
      increasingly, into developing marketing messages through customer advisory panels, brand ambassador positions, and
      the like. Today&apos;s consumers are also increasingly anxious about pressures ranging from the economy to
      globalization. Meanwhile, a creative class has emerged, consisting of professionals and artisans with an
      increasing desire for meaning in their lives. These factors all affect contemporary consumers&apos; purchasing
      behavior, filtering their choices based on their preference for engagement, Fair Trade sourcing, and/or
      self-expression, for example. </p>
    <a id="p224"></a>
    <p class="tx">The Great Recession of 2007&#x2013;2009, which has been described as the worst since the Great
      Depression, has also had an effect on consumers&apos; purchasing behavior (Ferrara, 2012). The economic recovery
      that has taken place since the Great Recession has been unequally distributed: Some urban centers (primarily those
      where the creative class thrives, like Seattle) weathered the recession well, while other regions replaced
      high-paying jobs (primarily in old-sector jobs like construction and manufacturing) with lower paying jobs (for
      example, in retail and food service), contributing to a widening income gap in America (Plumer, 2013). </p>
    <p class="tx">Despite an economic recovery, many consumers haven&apos;t been able to return to their previous
      behavioral purchasing patterns even if they would like to. In addition, consumers&apos; perception of the customer
      value equation may have been fundamentally altered by the recession. For example, in switching to lower priced
      consumer goods at the recession&apos;s outset, consumers may have discovered that the quality of the lower priced
      brand was higher than they expected (Bohlen, Carlotti, &amp; Mihas, 2009). In this financially constrained
      landscape, consumers may therefore develop different purchasing behaviors that marketers must closely monitor.</p>

      <p class="credit">georgeclerk/E+/Getty</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">Sales of environmentally sound products illustrate the dilemma consumers face in a
        financially constrained but humanity-centric world; green products generally cost more due to more expensive
        components and smaller sales volume.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="tx">Today&apos;s consumers are also increasingly anxious about the environment. A relatively modest number
      of American consumers adopted an environmental stewardship ethos in the 1960s or 1970s, waxing and waning since
      then under various forces, including the political climate, the economy, and social trends. After Al Gore&apos;s
      documentary <em>An Inconvenient </em><em>Truth</em> was released in 2006, consumer demand for environmentally
      sound products grew sharply, resulting in a &quot;green&quot; movement that sent marketers into a frenzy of
      developing new products for eco-conscious consumers (Lash, 2012). Suddenly green products, from recycled toilet
      paper to cleaning supplies, were flying off store shelves.</p>
    <p class="tx">But these products generally came at a higher cost. This was due in part to more expensive components
      but also to smaller volume sales. What consumers considered a good value when the economy was booming suddenly
      changed when the economy turned sharply downward in 2008. With reduced incomes and greater uncertainty about their
      future, many consumers were no longer willing to pay more for the added value of a form/function that promised to
      be kinder to the planet. Consumers still wanted to help the environment but felt they could not afford the extra
      cost. Therefore, fewer consumers purchased green products, and many waited for sales that would set the customer
      value equation back to a balance they could afford (Clifford &amp; Martin, 2011). The financial constraints on
      consumers ameliorated as the economy recovered, but a new &quot;normal&quot; for purchasing behavior emerged. The
      shock of losing household wealth and seeing familiar corporations close overnight made consumers spend less even
      as their disposable income neared prerecession levels. Clothing is one of the categories most affected by changing
      consumers, who not only buy fewer items of apparel but shop less frequently than before the recession, even years
      later (Reagan, 2015).</p>
    <a id="p225"></a>
    <p class="tx">What can we assume about these fundamentally different consumers of today? It&apos;s clear that they
      seek engagement. The Internet has greatly expanded individuals&apos; ability to find people with whom they share
      common interests. They connect with ideas that feel meaningful to them&#x2014;even if they&apos;re just discussing
      their favorite celebrity&apos;s latest gaffe. Marketers have been quick to respond to this demand for dialogue and
      engagement&#x2014;for example, by using technology to personalize interactions, simplify processes, and improve
      customer experiences. Self-serve customer service portals are one example, having emerged to serve the wishes of
      the 40% of consumers who prefer self-service over human contact (Mistry, 2016).</p>
    <p class="tx">In summary, consumers&apos; changing behavior reflects shifts in the macro environment around them.
      Shifts in any factor influencing purchasing behavior will cause consumers to continue to change what, how, where,
      and why they buy.</p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.1.2">The Purchase Decision Process</h2>
    <p class="tx">The behavior of consumers as they move from recognizing a need to making a purchase follows a
      predictable process. Each step in the process triggers a new set of thoughts and feelings. To design effective
      strategies, marketers need to be aware of what consumers face as they move from step to step, as illustrated in
      Table 7.2 and Figure 7.1.</p>

    </div>


    <p class="tx">Individuals&apos; purchase decision process is seldom completely linear, and each step may require a
      different amount of time. In addition, people are subject to the sociocultural influences on their purchasing
      behavior listed in Table 7.1. New information may cause a consumer to backtrack. Individuals frequently pause at a
      stage&#x2014;perhaps the purchase is not urgent, or the shopping process itself is pleasurable. In some
      situations, the individual never reaches the step of purchasing at all, because other needs or desires arise and
      cut the process short.</p>
    <p class="tx">Many major purchases, because of the complexity of purchase criteria to be met, leave the consumer
      with some degree of dissatisfaction. Some trade-off will have taken place, leaving an opening for the
      <strong>cognitive dissonance</strong> known as <strong>buyer&apos;s remorse</strong>. Because customer
      satisfaction is essential to building long-term relationships, marketers need to manage their consumers&apos;
      postpurchase emotions with supportive information such as testimonials from satisfied customers, warranties, and
      after-sales service.</p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.1.3">Degree of Involvement</h2>
    <p class="tx">The degree of involvement a consumer feels affects the consumer&apos;s purchase decision process. Some
      buying decisions require a high level of involvement. If the purchase reflects a high level of personal, social,
      or economic significance, a consumer is likely to feel deeply invested in the outcome and will put a good deal of
      energy and thought into making a choice. The information search step will take longer than for lower involvement
      purchases, and the potential for buyer&apos;s remorse is higher. Think about buying a loaf of bread and buying a
      car. The cost and the life span (and therefore the frequency of purchase) are quite different between the two. The
      buyer&apos;s degree of involvement is quite different as well.</p>
    <a id="p227"></a>
    <p class="tx">Consumers&apos; degree of involvement can be judged by considering the category in which a purchase
      falls (previously introduced in Chapter 3).</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl"><em>Convenience</em> products (such as snack foods and cleaning products) call for <em>routine
        </em><em>problem solving</em>. These purchases are typically a matter of habit, reflecting a low degree of
        involvement in the outcome. Consumers have little concern whether a convenience offering is likely to meet their
        expectations of value.</li>

      <li class="nl"><em>Shopping</em> products (such as furniture and clothing) call for <em>limited problem
          solving</em>. Several brands might be evaluated, depending on the time and effort the consumer has to spend,
        but the outcome does not carry enough risk to require greater effort.</li>

      <li class="nl"><em>Specialty</em> products (such as a car or a computer) call for <em>extended problem
          solving</em>. Purchases in this category require high consumer involvement to differentiate a long list of
        features and attributes, with far-reaching consequences to the decision.</li>

      <li class="nl"><em>Unsought</em> products (such as funeral services and fire extinguishers) may call for routine,
        limited, or extended problem solving depending on the offering&#x2014;but only after consumers have become aware
        of them and recognize a need or desire. Consider when frozen microwaveable dinners first became available in
        groceries&#x2014;until people learned about the new products&apos; utility, they did not feel desire for them or
        seek them out.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="tx">Purchasing a $2 candy bar to support a local cause would call for a low degree of involvement. Getting
      a vision screening might call for limited problem solving to choose an optometrist. Choosing a charity to name as
      beneficiary in one&apos;s will would call for extended problem solving.</p>
    <p class="tx">Exceptions to these categories exist, of course. Sometimes people choose different brands just for the
      variety, like trying a new brand of pizza because it&apos;s on sale or new to the market, or trying frozen yogurt
      just to see if it tastes as good as higher calorie ice cream. Sometimes the situation is such that consumers must
      take what&apos;s offered. The person who walks into a convenience store for cough drops is not likely to agonize
      like the purchaser of a car or computer&#x2014;or even ice cream or pizza. When the purchase is a gift for someone
      else, that too affects the decision process in subtle ways. These categories merely offer a framework on which
      fuller understanding of consumer behavior can be built.</p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.1.4">Other Influences on the Purchase Decision Process</h2>
    <p class="tx">We have discussed sociocultural influences and the level of involvement the consumer brings to the
      task of making a purchase decision. But more is going on here. The situational influences surrounding the purchase
      decision process include the following.</p>

    <ul class="ul">

      <li class="bl">Marketing mix: The strategies regarding product, price, promotion, and place that marketers have
        chosen to make the offering appeal to the consumer.</li>

      <li class="bl">Customer value equation: The buyer&apos;s own beliefs about which benefits constitute a &quot;good
        enough&quot; or&#x2014;better yet&#x2014;a &quot;great&quot; value at a given price.</li>

      <li class="bl">Purchase task: Specifics of the level of involvement, number of brands, sellers, product
        attributes, and information sources required to make a purchase decision.</li>

      <li class="bl">Social surroundings: Presence of others can alter how a purchase decision is made.</li>

      <li class="bl">Physical surroundings: The retail environment affects what is purchased; merchandise assortments,
        traffic flow, displays, and perceptual cues (such as sale signs) all matter.</li>

      <li class="bl">State of mind: The buyer brings to the purchase decision certain attitudes and beliefs. Hunger,
        fatigue, or a recent glance at bank balances can positively or negatively influence willingness to spend.</li>
    </ul>
    <a id="p228"></a>
    <p class="tx">Add to what you have learned about sociocultural influences, degree of involvement, and situational
      influences the discussion coming up of psychological influences&#x2014;motivation&#x2014;and you will have a
      complete, 360-degree view of the influences on the consumer purchase decision process. How these will evolve as an
      increasingly diverse population of consumers changes is not yet known.</p>
    <p class="tx">It&apos;s time for a concrete example. Let&apos;s consider a potential customer of the Wing, an
      upscale combination of coworking space and social club for women that launched in Manhattan in 2016. Imagine Elle,
      a hypothetical New Yorker self-employed in her own business consulting firm. She is tired of working out of her
      home in Long Island and managing tiring commutes into the city to visit her clients. Choosing to become a member
      of a coworking space is a serious decision, because she will commit to paying monthly dues. Coworking spaces in
      the United States average $195 a month (Deskmag, 2010). Membership access to the elegant Wing premises in Soho
      begins at $250 a month. </p>

      <p class="photo-caption">The Wing&apos;s marketing mix includes feminist branding.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="tx">What Elle wants most is a place to recharge, refresh, and be productive between client calls. For
      Elle, this isn&apos;t a convenience or shopping product&#x2014;a desk in a coworking space is a specialty product
      requiring extended problem solving that takes into account the influences on the purchase decision process listed
      above. The Wing&apos;s marketing mix, from its feminist branding to its upscale locations, are appealing to Elle.
      She&apos;s visited alternatives to evaluate the Wing&apos;s customer value equation and soon realized that the
      physical and social surroundings the Wing offers appealed to her more than other coworking spaces. But that $250
      monthly rent is more expensive than other coworking spaces she has looked at. What tipped Elle into applying for a
      Wing membership? Her state of mind, after trying to take a conference call from a table at Starbucks yet again,
      then changing clothes in its bathroom. She convinced herself the Wing would significantly enhance her quality of
      life at work. She told herself its membership fee is justifiable because it will bring exposure to potential new
      clients and referrals through her new sisterhood.</p>

    <a id="p229"></a>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.1.5">The Purchase Decision Process for Businesses</h2>
    <p class="tx">Is the purchase decision process different for businesses buying from other businesses? Yes and no.
      The process is similar in that influences on decision makers come from environmental factors. These include
      organizational factors such as policies, procedures, and systems and interpersonal factors such as authority,
      status, control of rewards, and persuasiveness. All the individual factors influencing consumer purchases
      described previously also influence business buying decision processes, since people don&apos;t stop being who
      they are when they get to work each day.</p>
    <p class="tx">The business buying decision process differs from the consumer buying process in that businesses often
      require significant time to identify requirements, put out requests for proposals, and/or engage in extensive
      negotiations. The organizational buying process usually involves more decision makers than the consumer buying
      process does. In addition, most business purchases are based on derived demand, and the buyers themselves are less
      often involved in the actual consumption of the product or service than in consumer buying processes.</p>
    <p class="tx">When buyers in business-to-business situations need to make purchases, they may be looking for a</p>

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="bl"><strong>straight rebuy</strong> (a routine reorder, requiring little thought or process);</li>

      <li class="bl"><strong>modified rebuy</strong> (in which the situation is complicated by the need for a new
        consideration set to meet changes sought in specifications, prices, terms, or suppliers); or</li>

      <li class="bl"><strong>new task</strong> (in which the full purchase decision process will take place, virtually
        identical to the consumer process described previously).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tx">A business buying process may include additional steps of assigning responsibility for the purchase
      decision, identifying selection criteria per the needs of those who will actually use the purchased product or
      service, and establishing a selection procedure that includes a team made up of users, influencers, and the actual
      individual(s) with buying authority.</p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.1.6">With Cocreation, the Purchase Decision Process Evolves</h2>
    <p class="tx">The purchase decision process has been a staple of marketing education for decades. Does the arrival
      of Marketing 3.0, with its emphasis on collaboration and cocreation, require an update to the way we conceptualize
      this aspect of our consumers&apos; experiences? Evidence suggests the answer is yes. The term <strong><em>customer
          experience journey</em></strong> has entered the conversation, meaning the cumulative impact of the
      experiences a customer has through interacting with a company, its brand, and its goods and services. The shift is
      toward a focus on the holistic customer experience, as opposed to the transactions or stages along the way.</p>
    <p class="tx">David Nour, in his 2017 book <em>Co-create: How Your Business Will Profit From Innovation and
      </em><em>Strategic Collaboration</em>, depicts the customer experience journey as an infinity symbol, in which
      customers continually travel through loops of evaluation, discovery, and consideration (equivalent to the three
      steps of the traditional purchase decision process) followed by loops of evaluation, purchase decision, and use
      (postpurchase behavior) that ends in a &quot;trial&quot; relationship with the company and its offering, as shown
      in Figure 7.2 (Nour, 2017). If the trial relationship is positive, it will deepen into a mutually beneficial
      long-term connection, characterized by cocreation of value. If the trial is negative, that opportunity is lost.
      Nour&apos;s contribution to the subject is to emphasize marketers&apos; need to focus on the transitions between
      these stages, rather than treating each as an isolated transaction. The motive is to harvest lifetime value from
      customers, and the implication is that companies will need to reorganize their marketing, sales, and customer
      support functions to give customers the personalized, meaningful experience they seek throughout the journey.</p>

    </div>


    <p class="tx">A technique called <strong>customer experience mapping</strong> (or customer journey mapping) has come
      into use to support this shift to the holistic view of the customer purchase decision process. It is essentially
      &quot;a walk in the shoes&quot; of a typical customer as he or she heads around Nour&apos;s infinite loop. Often
      conveyed by infographics, these &quot;maps&quot; tell the story of various target customer segments&apos;
      experience in a way that reinforces the centrality of the customer experience and demonstrates the need for the
      entire organization to adopt the marketing orientation. Both concepts advance the way we conceptualize a
      brand&apos;s orientation to its consumers&apos; experiences.</p>

      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 7.1: </strong><em>Changing Consumer Demand</em></h1>

    <p class="tx">To summarize: As consumers complete the tasks in the purchase decision process, the three types of
      factors influencing the purchase decision process (sociocultural influences, degree of involvement, and
      situational influences) come to bear. Consumers are changing, but to understand them, a study of the factors
      influencing buying behavior will remain useful.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Consider a recent purchase you made that would qualify as a &quot;shopping&quot; experience
        requiring limited problem solving, or a &quot;specialty&quot; experience requiring extended problem solving.
        Describe your own behavior as you completed each task of the purchase decision process, or describe your journey
        following Nour&apos;s infinite loop. Describe the situational and other influences affecting you as you faced
        each task.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec7.2">7.2&#x2002;&quot;It&apos;s All In Their Minds&quot;&#x2014;Emotions and Motivations</h1>
    <p class="tx">Underlying all consumer behavior are individual factors driven by human psychology&#x2014;the
      perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes that influence personal behavior. Individuals have always experienced wants
      and needs, many of them strong enough to demand satisfaction. That inner drive is called motivation.</p>
    <p class="tx">Multiple frameworks exist for understanding motivation, emerging since the growth of psychology in the
      early 20th century. Today&apos;s marketers study the psychology of motivation to stimulate purchasing a specific
      product, supporting a cause, or expressing loyalty to a brand.</p>
    <p class="tx">One of the most prominent psychologists to develop a theory of human motivation was Abraham Maslow,
      whose concept of the <em>hierarchy of needs</em> was discussed in Chapter 1. Maslow laid the groundwork for our
      contemporary understanding of the drives that propel consumers. Subsequent research takes that groundwork in new
      directions relevant for marketers.</p>
    <p class="tx">Today&apos;s theories of motivation recognize that purchasing behavior includes both cognitive and
      emotional components. Needs may be <strong>utilitarian needs</strong> or <strong>hedonic needs</strong>. To
      understand the difference, consider how you feel about two purchases: a water heater and concert tickets. The
      former fills a need, but it isn&apos;t likely to move you aesthetically or help you express yourself the way the
      latter will. Utilitarian needs derive from a practical service the purchase will perform. Utilitarian needs
      trigger little emotional response, so advertising for utilitarian products and services typically focuses on facts
      that help the consumer evaluating service utility.</p>
    <p class="tx">Hedonic needs reflect a desire to achieve pleasure, not just service, from the offering. Hedonic needs
      open the door to aesthetic appreciation, self-expression, fantasy, and adventure. Marketing messages for offerings
      that fill hedonic needs usually play on the emotions.</p>
    <p class="tx">Now consider the difference between buying a leaf blower and a business suit. Technically, each is
      designed to deliver a specific utility&#x2014;the blower will rid a yard of leaves, and the suit will keep a
      businessperson clothed appropriately for certain situations. But most purchasers would describe the leaf blower as
      a utilitarian purchase and would follow a purchase decision path based on utilitarian factors like weight, fuel
      consumption (electric or gas), and cost. The business suit would likely be seen as closer to a hedonic need,
      because of the aesthetics and self-expression involved in choosing a style, fabric, and fit. In terms of
      Maslow&apos;s hierarchy, the individual seeking a leaf blower would likely insist it is a need on the order of
      safety and security, required for the proper upkeep of that expensive investment, a home. The business suit would
      ride a little higher on the pyramid, involved as clothing is in the realms of belonging and esteem. On the other
      hand, one could argue that a leaf blower tops a business suit as a display of a kind of performative machismo.

    <a id="p232"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.2.1">More Influences on Motivation: Self-Expression, Brand Loyalty, and Identity</h2>
    <p class="tx">In a consumer society, individuals show each other who they are by what they have. The behavior starts
      early, as children experiment with forming identities, either copying the style of individuals they admire or
      inventing their own. Children quickly learn which brand names confer status.</p>
    <p class="tx">As children grow into adults, they become more sophisticated at using their purchasing power for
      self-expression. Almost everyone enjoys purchasing the props that project specific identities, whether that means
      camping gear, runway fashion, or the latest personal technology.</p>
    <p class="tx">Virginia Postrel, in her book <em>The Substance of Style</em>, makes the case that &quot;the more
      choices we have, the more responsibility we face&#x2014;whether or not we want it&#x2014;to define ourselves
      aesthetically. Because others make similar selections, for similar reasons, <em>I like this</em> becomes
      <em>I&apos;m </em><em>like this</em>.&quot; Postrel (2003) is talking about the power of brands to confer status.

      <p class="credit">Associated Press</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">T-shirts based on the Harry Potter movies reflect that consumers define themselves
        aesthetically through purchases, making a connection between &quot;I like this&quot; and &quot;I am this.&quot;
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="tx">A line of clothing based on popular movies illustrates Postrel&apos;s point. Disney announced in 2018
      it was teaming with lifestyle brand Her Universe to bring activewear featuring Disney, Star Wars, and Marvel
      characters to children and young teens, with the first products inspired by Marvel Entertainment&apos;s Black
      Panther and Disney&apos;s Princesses, and Star Wars gear soon to follow. The new products are &quot;opening up
      opportunities for fangirls to express their fandom and individuality&quot; (as cited in Chen, 2018), says Jimmy
      Pitaro, chair of Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media. The line includes leggings, sweatpants, hoodies,
      swimwear, footwear, and accessories (Chen, 2018).</p>


    <p class="tx">Why would a young person want to wear clothing that takes its design cues from characters in a movie?
      The reason could be to draw on the strength of its hero, like a shaman who wears a bearskin to take on the
      attributes of the bear. It could be to display membership in a fan community. Or one could choose a Black Panther
      or Snow White jacket just to feel the connection between &quot;I like this&quot; and &quot;I am this.&quot;</p>
    <a id="p233"></a>
    <p class="tx">When purchases allow us to feel affiliated with others&#x2014;part of a tribe&#x2014;they meet social
      needs. When purchases make us feel confident and strong, they meet self-esteem needs. The wants and needs of
      individuals making their way up Maslow&apos;s hierarchy of needs can be seen as drivers of humanity-centric
      Marketing 3.0 consumer behavior, accepting the responsibility to define oneself aesthetically as described by
      Virginia Postrel.</p>
    <p class="tx">More recently, researchers have begun to tie people&apos;s use of consumption for self-expression to
      brand loyalty. Consumers may develop brand loyalty motivated by a desire to conform to a reference group.
      Following fashion trends illustrates the use of brands to fulfill a hedonic need to belong. Alternatively,
      consumers&apos; hedonic motivation to break away from the present environment can translate to loyalty to the
      brands that represent freedom from conforming to the constraints of a mass-market society. The
      Harley&#x2013;Davidson brand community, whose members integrate the brand into multiple facets of their lives from
      community events to fashion statements, illustrates consumption of a brand as a sanctuary in which the consumer
      experiences &quot;a transcendental escape from the mundane&quot; (Labreque, Krishen, &amp; Grzeskowiak, 2011, p.
      470). Either hedonic need&#x2014;conformity or escapism&#x2014;can have a positive influence on brand loyalty.
      This is good news for marketers who want to use psychological principles to stimulate and direct consumer
      purchasing behavior.</p>

       <p class="tx">Another psychological principle that applies to human motivation is identity-based motivation, a
      theory that explores how people&apos;s identities motivate them to take specific action toward their goals. How
      does identity-based motivation apply to marketing? Identity drives our behavior related to what we approach or
      avoid. For example, in 2016 researchers studied how cultural identities influence attitudes about food packaging.
      They found that the French cultural identity esteems food as a hedonic pleasure, an attitude in conflict with the
      pragmatic nature of nutrition information on packages. Therefore, if you were preparing to introduce Special K
      Nourish cereal with probiotics in France, your understanding of identity-based motivation would lead you to alter
      everything about the cereal&apos;s packaging and brand narrative for the French market to emphasize hedonism over
      utility for digestive health. (Gomez &amp; Torelli, 2015). Like self-expression and brand loyalty, marketers can
      use the psychological principle of identity-based motivation to encourage certain consumer purchasing behaviors.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.2.2">The Role of Emotions</h2>
    <p class="tx">One more aspect of consumer behavior deserves attention: the role of emotions. Motivations can be
      experienced as either positive or negative emotions. Emotions produce feelings that trigger the urge to act.
      People act on positive motivations to achieve desires; they act on negative motivations to avoid worry and
      uncertainty. Purchasing a motorcycle fulfills a desire to satisfy a positive emotion. Purchasing life insurance
      fulfills a desire to avoid a negative emotion. Advertisers have been accused of preying on fear to trigger
      purchases (avoid bad breath with Listerine! Drive safely&#x2014;nobody will mess with you in a Hummer). But joy
      and connection can be just as powerful motivators as fear. Coca Cola&apos;s Open Happines&quot; campaign is one
      example (White, 2014).</p>
    <a id="p234"></a>
    <p class="tx">Not only do emotions move a person to make a purchase; emotions can influence that consumer&apos;s
      decision about whether the purchase is a good value. Pleasant emotional experiences often lead to customer
      loyalty, while unpleasant emotional experiences beg to be shared, which leads to negative word of mouth. Provoking
      a favorable emotional response through engagement with potential consumers is a fundamental task of advertising
      and marketing. Marketers make use of this insight to trigger consumers&apos; motivation to purchase by positioning
      their offerings on emotional benefits. The benefit may promise a positive emotion, such as increased happiness or
      greater energy, or a promise of reduced negative emotion, such as stress relief.</p>

    <p class="tx">In conclusion: Marketers study consumer behavior, motivation, and emotions because they need to
      understand how consumers shop and decide what to buy. Marketers need to understand how buyers see the world: what
      stimulates them to feel a need, what triggers them to act, what purchase criteria matter to them, and what mental
      and emotional processes they go through to decide which item gets rung up as a sale.</p>
    <p class="tx">Knowing enough about consumer psychology to recognize &quot;where prospective buyers are coming
      from&quot; is important for any marketer. But as you&apos;re about to learn, all that pales in usefulness compared
      to the insights possible from tracking and analyzing hard data about consumer purchases. Behavioral profiling
      yields more marketing insight than psychology. And so, we move on to the data-driven strategy of segmentation,
      targeting, and positioning.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">How might you apply your knowledge of consumer psychology to develop marketing tactics? Recall what
        you learned about the four Ps in previous chapters. Suggest how insights into consumer motivations and emotions
        might be applied to each of the four areas of the marketing mix: product, place, price, and promotion.</p>

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec7.3">7.3&#x2002;The &quot;STP&quot; Approach: Segmentation,
      Targeting, and Positioning</h1>
    <p class="tx">The STP fuel additive was designed to increase engine performance and fuel efficiency. &quot;STP&quot;
      for marketing performs a similar feat&#x2014;increasing marketing campaign performance while making fuel (money)
      go further in terms of results (as measured by return on investment, or ROI).</p>
    <p class="tx">The approach is simple: Companies <em>segment</em> their market to identify clusters of potential
      customers, and then <em>target</em> those customers for specific marketing communications, which are designed to
      <em>position</em> the company&apos;s offering and brand to stand out from competitors.</p>
    <p class="tx">The STP approach works because it leverages the fundamental insight of market segmentation: Not
      everybody will buy a company&apos;s goods and services. Some are more likely to buy than others, and for different
      reasons. When marketers use their understanding of buying behavior to divide the total market into smaller,
      relatively homogeneous groups, they can deliver greater value to customers, more efficiently and cost-effectively.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.3.1">No More &quot;One Size Fits All&quot;</h2>
    <p class="tx">A <strong>market segment</strong> consists of a group of people who share a similar set of needs and
      wants, usually because they share other traits, such as geography, age, income, and/or lifestyle. Because of their
      commonalities, people within a segment are likely to share perceptions of the specific customer value equation for
      a particular offering. For example, parents are likely to value Avon Skin So Soft for its usefulness as a bath oil
      safe for children&apos;s tender skin, while outdoor enthusiasts value the same product for its effectiveness as a
      nontoxic insect repellent.</p>

    <div class="photo-box-right">
      <img id="img7.4" class="scaled" alt="Skin So Soft Avon product." title="Skin So Soft Avon product."
        src="images/7.4.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Associated Press</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">People within a segment are likely to value a product for the same reason. Can you think
        of another product like Avon&apos;s Skin So Soft oil that has such disparate market segments?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="tx">Marketers use the insight that some segments are more likely to buy than others to concentrate
      resources on the probable buyers. Once a segment has been identified as potentially profitable, marketers focus on
      identifying the behaviors and motivations that affect the segment&apos;s buying decisions. Only with a clear
      understanding of those factors can marketers develop marketing mix strategies that deliver value to that segment.
    </p>
    <p class="tx">Marketers may conduct primary research or purchase secondary research (defined in Chapter 2) to
      understand market segments. This may result in positioning an existing offering differently or developing a
      product extension or even a new product innovation to meet an unfilled need that has come to light.</p>
    <p class="tx">Information about market segments can be purchased from outside firms or derived from customer
      transactions in a company&apos;s database or <strong>customer relationship management (CRM)</strong> system. CRM
      is a strategy for tracking a company&apos;s interactions with customers and prospects and organizing information
      from sales, marketing, and customer service activities. CRM software functions as a central location for all data
      about customers and prospects. We cover CRM in more detail later in this chapter.</p>
    <a id="p236"></a>
    <p class="tx">STP is not the only approach to reaching customers. Marketers have at their disposal the
      <strong>undifferentiated strategy</strong>, in which all consumers are treated the same. When the offering is a
      commodity&#x2014;that is, all competitors&apos; offerings are about the same in terms of features and
      price&#x2014;segmentation may offer little additional profit potential to offset the cost of more complex
      marketing strategies.</p>
    <p class="tx">Segmentation strategies call for tough choices. The number of variables that differentiate consumers
      within any given product category can be bewildering. The variables relevant to purchase propensity must be
      identified, to weed out those that are not. Marketers need criteria to narrow down the possible approaches to
      those most likely to be both productive and cost-effective.</p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.3.2">Selecting Market Segments to Target</h2>
    <p class="tx">Target marketing focuses resources on those groups of potential customers who are likely to have
      greater demand for a good or service. Target marketing requires choosing a specific market segment, with the
      intent of developing a product offering and promoting a specific value proposition that will motivate that group
      of people to act.</p>
    <p class="tx">A segment must meet certain criteria to qualify as a target worthy of its own marketing strategy. A
      target segment must be</p>
    <ul class="ul">

      <li class="bl">available in the marketplace in sufficient numbers to merit the expense,</li>

      <li class="bl">readily identifiable, and</li>

      <li class="bl">able to be profitably served.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tx">Consider Lunchables, the convenience food product introduced in 1988 by Oscar Mayer. Working parents,
      pressed for time, were struggling to feed their families breakfast, much less get lunches packed. These parents
      (who in 1988 were mostly moms) were available in the marketplace, easily identified, and&#x2014;because Oscar
      Mayer had excess lunchmeat production capacity&#x2014;able to be profitably served (Moss, 2013). </p>
    <p class="tx">If a target segment fails to meet any of these three conditions, the company should not pursue it. All
      segments meeting these conditions are theoretically worthy of targeting, but there are other considerations. In
      addition to the target segment being large enough to merit investment, readily identifiable, and potentially
      profitable, consider the following criteria:</p>
    <ul class="ul">

      <li class="bl">How well is this segment being served by competitors?</li>

      <li class="bl">Is this segment expected to grow?</li>

      <li class="bl">Is this segment a good fit with the company&apos;s brand image and market position?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tx">Prepackaged lunches for schoolchildren was a new concept in 1988; there were no competitors. Census
      data clearly revealed a growing segment of households with children and the affluence to buy the product. The fit
      with the Oscar Mayer brand was unassailable.</p>
    <a id="p237"></a>
    <p class="tx">If a segment is already targeted and well served by competitors, there may not be an opening for a new
      company to create meaningful positioning. It will be too late to market on a message strategy of being
      &quot;first&quot; or &quot;best.&quot; Finding another position on which successful marketing messages can be
      built may be difficult. And even if a workable basis for differentiation can be found, it may not be one that fits
      well with the company&apos;s existing brand image. A company known for low prices or quality will have difficulty
      creating a new strategy around a contradictory position. If a segment fails to meet these criteria, it&apos;s a
      weak choice.</p>
    <p class="tx">Consider three more measures of a target market&apos;s suitability for segmentation strategy.</p>
    <ul class="ul">

      <li class="bl">Do individuals in the segment share common needs?</li>

      <li class="bl">Are they likely to respond similarly to a marketing action?</li>

      <li class="bl">Is the segment reachable? (Are message channels available?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tx">To conclude our Lunchables example, the product served a huge and fairly homogenous market segment
      already proven to respond to mass marketing. Oscar Mayer advertised Lunchables on Saturday morning cartoons. In
      short, the Lunchables concept passed all nine criteria for effective segmentation and, once launched, met with
      great success.</p>
    <p class="tx">These three criteria help marketers estimate the likelihood that effective campaigns can be designed
      for this market segment. Individuals who share common needs will tend to appreciate the same benefits, making
      persuasive marketing messages possible. However, if no message channel exists that reaches the segment
      cost-effectively, that can be a deal breaker. A marketer may desire to offer left-handed office supplies to that
      sizable group (10% of the population) but lack mailing lists or magazines through which to reach lefties. In that
      case, the left-handed niche is best given a pass.</p>
    <p class="tx">Table 7.3 summarizes the nine criteria that segments must meet to justify use of a segmentation
      strategy. Only market segments meeting these criteria for effective segmentation should be considered further.</p>

      target marketing strategy.</p>
    <a id="p238"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.3.3">Segmentation Variables</h2>
    <p class="tx">The first criterion indicating whether a market niche is suitable for a segmentation strategy is the
      size of the population meeting the segment description. This raises the question: what description?</p>
    <p class="tx">Variables used to identify segments have gone through several stages.</p>
    <p class="tx">Initially, market researchers relied on <strong>demographic segmentation</strong> because of the
      availability of information collected by the U.S. Census Bureau about education, income, and occupation, as well
      as physical attributes such as gender, race, and age. These variables proved reliable predictors for different
      consumption patterns and thus a workable basis for segmentation strategies (Kotler, 2005).</p>
    <p class="tx">Segmenting on a single variable, such as ethnic group, gender, or age, can be quite effective.
      Marketing to racial/ethnic groups grew as marketers recognized the rapidly rising spending power among Hispanics,
      African Americans, and Asian Americans. Marketing to women has increased dramatically as research revealed that
      female consumers influence the purchase of 85% of all products and services (Quinlan, 2003). Young people (ages 8
      to 24) have been called the next &quot;big spenders.&quot; A large percentage of children and teens make their own
      buying decisions, particularly on clothing and entertainment. Plus, with more time, skill, and interest in online
      product comparison, they exert considerable influence over their parents&apos; purchases (Gioia, 2012).</p>
    <p class="tx">Segmenting markets by age groups became popular in the 1990s to leverage the sociological concept
      known as the <em>cohort effect</em>&#x2014;the tendency of members of a generation to be influenced by significant
      events occurring during their formative years (Smith &amp; Clurman, 1998). Terms like <em>baby boomer</em> and
      <em>Generation X</em> identify specific generational cohorts. A shared influence&#x2014;be it Pearl Harbor or
      Pearl Jam&#x2014;can have a lasting effect on a segment&apos;s buying habits and response to marketing stimuli.
    </p>
    <p class="tx">Generational cohorts consist of age groups identifiable by a defining event during their formative
      years that led to a sense of shared experience and, to some extent, a shared worldview. There is power in
      examining a company&apos;s prospective customers by generational cohort. The experiences of each group as it hits
      life stages of courtship, marriage, child rearing, career advancement, and empty nesting tie to predictable
      purchasing behavior. With overall population growth, every generational cohort will expand&#x2014;through
      longevity for the oldest segment, birthrates for the youngest segment, and immigration for the middle of the
      population. The STP approach relies on these insights to craft strategies and messages that are more relevant and
      appealing to individuals in a cohort. </p>
    <p class="tx">Bear in mind that generational cohorts are analytical constructs; there is no consensus on the
      boundaries between one generational cohort and the next. Table 7.4 uses the boundaries defined by the Pew Research
      Center.</p>

      clues to each segment&apos;s probable needs and desires&#x2014;useful information for marketers.</p>
    <p class="credit_left">Source: Fry, 2016.</p>

    <p class="tx">Each cohort is believed to share certain traits, which marketers leverage to influence purchasing
      behavior. </p>

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="bl">Greatest generation: Affected by growing up during the Great Depression and serving in World War
        II; they developed a sense of duty to country and a strong work ethic.</li>
      <li class="bl">Silent generation: Experienced World War II as children or young adults; this cohort focused on
        conforming to social norms. </li>
      <li class="bl">Baby boom: Experienced assassinations, Vietnam War, and Watergate; developed tendencies toward
        experimentation and grew disillusioned with government.</li>
      <li class="bl">Generation X: Coming of age in the aftermath of the 1960s, they value autonomy and are not as
        work-centric as prior generations. Sometimes stereotyped as self-involved.</li>
      <li class="bl">Millennials: Grew up surrounded by economic prosperity and rapidly advancing technology but entered
        the workforce during a recession. They value career flexibility and work&#x2013;life balance (Nisen, 2013).
      </li>
      <li class="bl">Generation Z: Digital natives who grew up in uncertain times marked by military deployments, the
        Great Recession, and rising income inequality. Entrepreneurial by nature (Dill, 2015).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Millennials are overtaking baby boomers as the largest generational cohort in U.S. history and, as
      such, are attracting great interest among marketers. Their spending power in the United States is estimated to
      have reached $200 billion in 2018&#x2014;the most of any generation (Schroeder, 2017). </p>
    <p class="tx">Generation Z is estimated to be 25% of the U.S. population, an even larger cohort than the
      Millennials. What cohort will follow Generation Z, and will they be smaller than the cohort that preceded them,
      like the silent generation and Generation X, or will they be the largest cohort yet? What shared events will mark
      their cohort, and what will be the impact on marketing approaches? You will see the answer play out in your
      lifetime. </p>
    <a id="p240"></a>
    <p class="tx">We&apos;ll return to the subject of generational demographics in Chapter 8, when we consider social
      and cultural factors in the marketing environment.</p>
    <p class="tx">Marketers have also used <strong>geographic segmentation</strong>, based on where consumers live or
      work, to find groups with common needs and desires. As researchers grew more sophisticated about segmentation,
      these two techniques blended into <strong>geodemographic segmentation</strong>. This approach added variables such
      as consumers&apos; location relative to city center, suburb, or rural area, and type of homes, reflecting the fact
      that people in similar areas tended to exhibit similar consumption patterns.</p>
    <p class="tx">Geodemographic segmentation worked, but it left a wealth of useful information still unexplored,
      leading researchers to develop <strong>behavioral segmentation</strong>. In this approach, marketers classify
      people according to their motivations and attitudes, including reasons for purchases and quantities consumed. </p>
    <p class="tx">Studying a company&apos;s own transaction records generates a description of a <strong>foundation
        segment</strong> already in the customer base&#x2014;a description of its own customers by their geographic,
      demographic, and behavioral traits. The goal, of course, is to find more like them. Augmenting that description
      with data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey on the buying habits of U.S. consumers can lead to more
      sophisticated and effective use of specific variables to define market segments like a company&apos;s own best
      customers. (The Consumer Expenditure Survey is a national household survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau
      that provides annual data on expenditures, income, and demographic characteristics of consumers in the United
      States.)</p>
    <p class="tx">Marketers have based successful segmentation strategies on variables such as demographics, geography,
      and behavior, including features/benefits sought, usage rate, and degree of loyalty. But many companies lack the
      resources to build their own sophisticated segmentation system around the demographics, geography, and behaviors
      of their customers and prospects. Service providers developed <strong>psychographic segmentation</strong> systems
      available for purchase that accomplished fine-grained targeting by weaving together demographics, geography, and
      life stage/lifestyle descriptors. These systems assign households to specific clusters based on predictions about
      their behaviors, needs, and lifestyles. Companies could now purchase data sets based on clusters of households
      that &quot;look like&quot; their own best customers and fold those prospective customers into their data
      warehouses. The case study that closes this chapter examines use of the segmentation techniques discussed here.

    <p class="tx">Segmentation helps marketers understand potential customers in order to focus on those whose needs
      they can ultimately satisfy. It&apos;s not uncommon to mix and match segmentation approaches. For instance,
      marketers might combine geodemographic segmentation with segmentation on benefits sought, to design effective
      strategies. Figure 7.3 lists the steps in the process of executing a segmentation strategy.</p>

    <a id="p241"></a>

    <p class="tx">Segmenting business markets can be accomplished using the same process. B2B segmentation approaches
      can be geographic or demographic based on characteristics of the businesses targeted; this is sometimes referred
      to as <strong>firmographics</strong> (the descriptive attributes of firms that marketers use to combine individual
      firms into meaningful market segments). Size in sales or number of employees, customer business model, and
      industry are all useful variables on which to segment. The <strong>North American Industry Classification
        System</strong> maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau is the standard used for classifying businesses and the
      source from which firmographic data can be retrieved, sorted, and aggregated for purposes of target marketing.</p>

    <p class="tx">Behavioral segmentation, based on factors like motivations or usage rates, end-use application,
      product specifications, or stage in the customer relationship (newly acquired, existing, satisfied, or at-risk),
      is widely used in B2B marketing.</p>
    <p class="tx">Psychographic segmentation has not proven as useful in B2B marketing. The more complex makeup of the
      buying team (as opposed to an individual consumer), as well as the idiosyncrasies of specific industries, make the
      psychographic approach less useful in selling to businesses (Barry &amp; Weinstein, 2009).</p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.3.4">Positioning: The STP Approach&apos;s Final Step</h2>
    <p class="tx">Marketers, having a <em>segmentation strategy</em> to execute and a <em>target market segment</em> to
      address, face one more strategic task. They must now decide how to <em>position</em> the offering. As you&apos;ve
      learned from earlier chapters, <em>positioning</em> is the practice of creating an identity in the minds of
      prospective customers that allows one offering to stand out among many. The concept of positioning was discussed
      in Chapter 6.</p>
    <p class="tx">In the 1960s to 1980s, the period in which the STP approach emerged, it was not uncommon for marketers
      to go head-to-head in pursuit of a target market. They positioned offerings directly against competitors with
      similar product attributes. An often-used example from that era is the marketing of the rental car companies Avis
      and Hertz. In 1962 Hertz was using the slogan &quot;Let Hertz put you in the driver&apos;s seat&quot;&#x2014;a
      rather generic promise. Rival brand Avis, which had trailed Hertz since its inception, launched its &quot;we try
      harder&quot; campaign to position the company as the alternative with greater customer service spirit (Stevenson,
      2013). During that era, the rapid increase in goods and services available led to more emphasis on competitive
      differentiation as marketers sought to stand out.</p>
    <p class="tx">Developing positioning strategy is part of the creative work of the campaign development step of the
      marketing process. Marketers write positioning statements that identify the target market and the need/desire that
      creates demand. The positioning statement describes how the offering delivers a solution that is unlike any
      competitor&apos;s. The positioning statement is usually part of the creative brief, developed for use within the
      marketing department.</p>
    <p class="tx">Positioning strategy reflects three components.</p>
    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">the target market&apos;s perception of the customer value equation for products in the
        consideration set</li>
      <li class="nl">the product offering&apos;s unique selling proposition (the promised benefit so compelling it
        motivates action)</li>
      <li class="nl">assessment of competitors&apos; positioning strategies</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="tx">The problems, needs, and desires of the target market are fundamental to selection of a positioning
      strategy. But just as important, the position must be one the company can authentically claim, and one its
      competitors have not chosen to emphasize.</p>
    <p class="tx">To find an opening for a successful positioning strategy, marketers will typically plot competitors or
      products on dimensions of competition that are important to targeted consumers. Such dimensions might include
      perceived quality and price or style and product assortment. One example of these diagrams, called
      <strong>perceptual maps</strong>, is shown in Figure 7.4. This technique can also be used to compare companies
      with multiple brands or product lines.</p>
    <a id="p243"></a>
    <div class="figure-box">
      <h4 class="figure-name">Figure 7.4: Perceptual map</h4>
      <h5 class="figure-title">Perceptual maps allow marketers to assess competitors&apos; positioning strategies to
        find an unclaimed position.</h5>
      <img src="figures/fig_7.4.jpg" alt="Figure of a perceptual map example."
        title="Figure of a perceptual map example." class="figure" id="fig_7.4">
    </div>

    <p class="tx">B2B marketers position products just as carefully as consumer marketers do, using the same tools. A
      marketer might aim to sell a good or service to both business and consumer markets, positioning the same offering
      for different uses. For instance, a combined printer/scanner sold as a business tool might be adapted by its
      manufacturer for home use, transforming it into a consumer product.</p>
    <p class="tx">As you&apos;ve learned, the STP approach is widely used by today&apos;s marketers. Application of the
      nine criteria for effective segmentation keeps the approach profitable and productive of long-term customer
      relationships. Analyzing the cost versus benefit of a segmentation approach is critical to its success. The value
      of the customers gained must be sufficient to warrant the increased cost of a segmentation strategy over the cost
      of an undifferentiated strategy.</p>
    <p class="tx">Some marketers ask: Does it make sense to weigh some of the criteria more heavily than others? For
      example, can one succeed by targeting &quot;easy&quot; prospects who are readily identifiable, share common needs,
      and can be reached through available message channels, but who show little potential to be profitably served? Or
      is it better to target the &quot;harder&quot; prospects who, if attracted, might spend more and thus yield more
      profit over time? The answer can come only from estimating the potential for return on investment from such a
      strategy. </p>
    <a id="p244"></a>
    <p class="tx">Does the STP approach assure success? Not if faulty data interferes with decisions about any of the
      nine criteria in the segmentation process. &quot;Is the segment reachable?&quot; was a problem when Gillette tried
      to regain market share lost to Dollar Shave Club in 2017. It undertook an STP campaign aimed at young men turning
      18, who would receive a birthday promotion that included a free razor with the message, &quot;You didn&apos;t claw
      your way into manhood only to shave with a toy&quot; (Maheshwari, 2017, para. 11), according to a <em>New York
        Times</em> article about the campaign. The problem was, people outside the target segment, including women,
      received the promotion. When asked how it determined who would receive the mailing, Gillette said &quot;it uses
      sign-ups on its websites and opt-ins from retailers, as well as other &#x2018;commercially available sources&apos;
      like magazine subscriptions&quot; (Maheshwari, 2017, para. 10), the article reported. Gillette&apos;s target
      market was not as reachable as it believed. As this example shows, no criteria in the segmentation process can be
      omitted without weakening the strategy.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Managing the STP approach seems straightforward when one considers a company with one product. But
        companies following the product line expansion strategy develop products to fulfill unmet needs and soon are
        managing many products. A focus on one-to-one marketing communications creates even more complexity. What issues
        do you foresee related to managing increasing complexity when applying the STP approach?</p>
      <p class="tx">Not all differences between offerings are meaningful to the consumer. When it comes to positioning,
        how do marketers decide which differences to promote? What could marketers do to ensure that the differences
        they&apos;ve elected to emphasize in a positioning strategy will resonate with consumers?</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec7.4">7.4&#x2002;Driving Better Strategies With Customer Data</h1>
    <p class="tx">Marketing practices increasingly rely on customer data, reflecting the shift described in Chapter 1
      from the marketing era to the relationship era, with its objective of developing long-term relationships with
      customers. We&apos;ll close this chapter with a deeper look at these customer relationships, but first, an
      introduction to how data supports managing those relationships will be helpful. As you think about managing
      customer relationships, bear in mind the customer experience journey discussed earlier in this chapter. What data
      can be captured at each of the transactional stages in that journey? How might that data lead to stronger bonds,
      deeper engagement, and more cocreation of value between companies and their customers?</p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.4.1">Customer Relationship Management: A Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="tx">The marketing practice known as CRM emerged from contact management software developed to serve B2B
      sales management in the 1980s. The first simple systems were designed to replace Rolodexes but quickly expanded
      with features designed to automate routine sales and customer service tasks, such as quote management (Muhney,
      2011).</p>
    <p class="tx">CRM was sold as a technology solution that would manage detailed information about individual
      customers and thus drive greater precision in identifying the most desirable prospective customers. As technology,
      it was little more than a database harnessed for marketing purposes. But CRM is more than a technology. It&apos;s
      more than a customer service support system or a customer-acquisition marketing program&#x2014;it&apos;s an entire
      philosophy of customer-centrality. CRM is technology with a marketing orientation.</p>
    <a id="p245"></a>
    <p class="tx">Living by the CRM philosophy calls for breaking down silos that separate customer data collected by a
      company from sales, marketing, and customer service activities. It means bringing the data together into a
      centralized warehouse. Some practitioners separate the terms used for the data warehouse from the CRM system
      itself, referring to the database as the <strong>marketing customer information file</strong>. Data from such a
      database can be analyzed in depth and the resulting knowledge applied to marketing actions that build stronger
      customer relationships. Another tool closely linked to CRM is a <strong>marketing information system</strong>,
      designed to support managers&apos; decision making by distributing access to timely, accurate information about
      customers, market trends, and more. Whatever the system is called that supports the CRM philosophy, its strength
      lies in its potential for data mining. Analyzing the collected data reveals significant trends, patterns, and
      relationships.</p>
    <p class="tx">Computing power, communication, and Internet technologies expanded exponentially in the 1990s and
      early 2000s, which led to rapid growth in the number of companies using CRM. But not every company benefits from
      attempting to adopt CRM. Tracking every purchase, sales contact, service encounter, website visit, and payment
      transaction for every individual in the system demands a lot of resources. Expertise in data analytics also comes
      at a high cost. For some companies, the work flow required to manage customer information on such a fine-grained
      level is simply too expensive and labor intensive. CRM has proved to be most effective in industries that are
      already generating reams of data and serving large customer markets, such as financial services,
      telecommunications, and large-scale retailers.</p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.4.2">Stocking the Data Warehouse</h2>
    <p class="tx">Customer information originates in various systems across an organization. A financial institution,
      for example, maintains files on loans and deposits, plus records from credit cards, online banking, and
      investments. Those records stock the data warehouse. Routine upkeep of the warehouse requires <strong>data
        cleansing</strong>: detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records, followed by basic
      analytics that combine accounts at identical addresses into households. These are referred to as
      <em>relationships</em>, the basic building block of CRM. The data warehouse is typically augmented with
      demographic information purchased from third-party suppliers. This makes the data set even more useful (if the
      purchased data is reliable, that is).</p>
    <p class="tx">Analytic routines performed on these augmented data sets produce reports that answer marketers&apos;
      questions and suggest campaign strategies. Mining customer data can produce reports such as the following.</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="bl">Life stage segmentation: Grouping customer records by geodemographic and behavioral variables to
        develop target market segments.</li>
      <li class="bl">Firmographic segmentation: Developing target market segments for B2B marketing.</li>
      <li class="bl">Customer metrics: Measuring customer satisfaction, engagement, loyalty, risk for attrition, and so
        on.</li>
      <li class="bl">Customer lifetime value: Estimating the dollar value based on total profit (or loss) likely to
        result from a customer over the life of the relationship.</li>
      <li class="bl">RFM analysis: Combining the recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) value of customer transactions
        to quantify the value of the relationship as a basis for segmentation.</li>
      <li class="bl">CPA analysis: Calculating cost per acquisition (CPA) against marketing campaign ROI.</li>
    </ul>
    <a id="p246"></a>
    <p class="tx">These insights from CRM lead to stronger relationships and better marketing strategy development.</p>
    <p class="tx">Information relevant to segmenting, targeting, and positioning can be drawn from the data warehouse,
      including the following.</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="bl">descriptive information, such as demographics and media habits</li>
      <li class="bl">product usage information, including buying behavior, consumption patterns, and loyalty to specific
        brands</li>
      <li class="bl">customer perception information, such as likes and dislikes, perceptions of a product or
        service&apos;s features, and whether those features deliver benefits valued by consumers</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tx">Customer transaction data can also be brought to business planners. Information flowing from the CRM
      system can be used to guide market research and strategic planning.</p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.4.3">Making Marketing Information Useful</h2>
    <p class="tx">For customer data to be useful to a company, much more is needed than names, addresses, and
      contact/transaction history. Each campaign addressed to each relationship should be tracked. If a particular
      household received a New Movers promotion triggered by a change of address and a Thank You promotion triggered by
      a first purchase, that information is extremely useful to marketers planning subsequent promotions to that
      household.</p>
    <p class="tx">The information in the data warehouse is useful for more than planning targeted and one-to-one
      marketing campaigns. That information leads to more successful marketing strategies using a concept introduced in
      Chapter 6: predictive analytics, the science of making calculated guesses about unknown future events. At the core
      of this technique are <strong>predictive models</strong>, analytic routines that attempt to predict the
      probability of an outcome given a set of input data. Predictive modeling produces relationship-level models that
      describe the likelihood that a customer will take a particular action. Predictive modeling helps marketers answer
      questions like the following.</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="bl">Will my customer switch to a competitor? When? Which customer relationships could be saved with
        marketing action?</li>
      <li class="bl">Who will buy which of our products?</li>
      <li class="bl">Which product will the customer buy next? When?</li>
      <li class="bl">Where should we locate our next store?</li>
    </ul>
    <a id="p247"></a>
    <p class="tx">What does the average marketer need to know about the highly technical field of data analytics? Just
      the basics: Predictive analytics work when good data exists, when the right statistical tools are used to test the
      analyst&apos;s hypothesis, and when the assumptions that undergird the predictive model are valid. </p>
    <p class="tx">Lack of good data is a common barrier, which is why attention to stocking the data warehouse is so
      important. A good, clean, current customer data set&#x2014;meaning one in which duplicates have been removed and
      inaccuracies corrected on a regular basis&#x2014;is a significant asset for a company. </p>
    <p class="tx">One of the most commonly used tools for predictive modeling is <strong>regression analysis</strong>.
      (Other analytic tools are used as well, but let&apos;s stick with the basics.) In its various forms, regression
      analysis determines the strength of the relationship between one dependent variable and other independent
      variables. Usually, analysts develop a hypothesis about a set of independent variables, such as income, age, and
      website visits, and then tests the hypothesis with a regression analysis performed on a sample of the data set to
      test how the variables correlate to each other. This usually takes several iterations. The result allows the
      analyst to score all records in the data warehouse with a number representing likelihood of a specific outcome,
      like website visits or product purchases.</p>
    <p class="tx">Every predictive model rests on assumptions. The grand assumption behind predictive models is that
      past behavior predicts future behavior. And yet people change&#x2014;and so does their behavior. Factors in the
      environment shift as well. The collapse of the housing market in 2008&#x2013;2009 was caused largely by faulty
      assumptions about the future of housing prices, leading to invalid predictive models about mortgage loan
      repayment. Predictive models become obsolete over time and must be reassessed (Davenport, 2014). </p>
    <p class="tx">With predictive models in hand, marketers develop plans for marketing actions to stimulate desirable
      outcomes or forestall undesirable ones (SAS, 2011). Predictive models can, for example, drive <strong>trigger
        marketing</strong>, a technique in which an action by a consumer automatically &quot;triggers&quot; a marketing
      action.</p>
    <p class="tx">Consider the case of a hypothetical cell phone service provider, Calluniverse. Its marketers recognize
      a need to reduce <strong>churn</strong> (attrition of customers) and set a goal of increasing contract renewals.
      Calluniverse data analysts draw on their data warehouse to define market segments with high churn <em>and</em>
      high customer lifetime value scores. Analysis reveals three distinct clusters of users across two
      dimensions&#x2014;usage revenue and access revenue share.</p>
    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">users with high-usage revenue share (earned from per-minute charges)</li>
      <li class="nl">users with high balances</li>
      <li class="nl">users with high-access revenue share (earned from rate plans)</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="tx">Each segment is then targeted with distinct offers to encourage contract renewal. Based on the
      analysis, Calluniverse marketers decide to offer the high-usage revenue cluster a free phone upgrade, the
      high-balance cluster free text messaging, and the high-access revenue cluster a 15% discount on the first
      month&apos;s fee after contract renewal. Because each offer targets the specific usage pattern of a distinct
      segment, it generates higher responses. Thus, it not only increases revenue but also accomplishes the ultimate
      campaign goal&#x2014;reduced churn.</p>
    <a id="p248"></a>
    <p class="tx">Figure 7.5 shows the distribution of the three target segments by usage revenue share and access
      revenue share.</p>

    <div class="figure-box">

    <p class="tx">Customer lifetime value, one of the scores Calluniverse used in the hypothetical example, was defined
      in Chapter 1 as the total profit (or loss) estimated to result from a relationship with a customer over time. This
      score is worth noting as we make the transition to our final topic in this chapter: the emphasis on relationships
      with customers. Formulas for calculating a customer&apos;s lifetime value can be intimidatingly complex. The
      variables typically used are recency, frequency, and monetary value of past purchases. From these
      &quot;knowns&quot; the &quot;unknown&quot; can be projected: the likelihood of retention and likely rate of
      repurchase in the future. Once the customer lifetime value of current customers has been calculated, the marketing
      analyst needs to create a scoring system to separate the most valuable customers from the rest, to be used when
      purchasing data from vendors (called <em>third-party data</em>) to find more new prospects who &quot;look
      like&quot; the company&apos;s best current customers. </p>


    <div class="box-2">
      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 7.4: </strong><em>Data Quality and CRM</em></h1>
      <p class="tx">It should now be clear that the quality of data used to drive marketing strategies is of utmost
        importance. Follow the link below to an article summarizing a discussion among marketers on data quality issues
        in using first-, second-, and third-party data.</p>

    <p class="tx">In summary, CRM supports the orientation toward customer relationships required to succeed in the
      Marketing 3.0 paradigm, having emerged from B2B marketing practices as technology for data management progressed.
      Adoption of the approach by consumer marketers has been most successful when both the customer-centrality required
      and the availability of vast transaction data have come together to yield sufficient additional revenue to cover
      CRM&apos;s higher cost.</p>
    <p class="tx">The CRM philosophy aligns a company around its customers, bringing together and enhancing the data
      collected at all its touchpoints. Drawing on that deep supply of customer information, data mining produces
      insights that optimize results as marketers execute the STP approach, based on predictive models. The practice by
      Calluniverse of segmenting its customers on revenue and access share is one example of CRM applied to improve
      marketing results.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Calluniverse segmented its customers on revenue and access share and improved marketing results. Can
        you describe other scenarios for marketing action based on customer analytics?</p>
      <p class="tx">Do you think the CRM philosophy can be successfully applied in developing countries, where
        demographic, transaction, and behavioral data are not as readily available? Why or why not? What factors could
        increase the success of CRM in global markets?</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec7.5">7.5&#x2002;Emphasis on the Relationship</h1>
    <p class="tx">In Chapter 1 we introduced the relationship era in marketing that began about 1990&#x2014;the era in
      which companies shifted their marketing focus to establishing relationships with customers that could endure over
      time and result in a predictable, ongoing share of a customer&apos;s purchases. Recognizing that consumers could
      easily compare similar offerings with product information readily available through company websites and social
      media, marketers began relying on positioning strategies to make their offerings distinct and placing value on
      relationships to earn customers&apos; loyalty.</p>
    <p class="tx">Philip Kotler&apos;s paradigm of Marketing 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 similarly characterized the shift in
      marketers&apos; view from customers as passive targets to customers as collaborative partners&#x2014;again,
      placing the greatest value on the relationship between a company and its customers.</p>
    <p class="tx">Relationship marketing has come into its own as marketers have recognized that in the marketing of
      services, the repeated contact between service providers and customers causes relationships to form organically.
      Viewed through the lens of service-dominant logic, <em>all</em> firms are service firms and thus are able to
      deepen relationships through repeated contact.</p>
    <p class="tx">When marketers focus on long-term relationships, they gain a deeper understanding of customers&apos;
      needs. This in turn leads to improvements in all aspects of marketing mix strategies and the value they ultimately
      deliver. As a result, marketers reduce the need for expensive new-customer-acquisition programs and instead enjoy
      greater marketing ROI through serving a loyal customer base.</p>
    <a id="p250"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.5.1">The Goal: Customers for Life</h2>
    <p class="tx">Long-lasting relationships seldom develop overnight. Instead, trust builds slowly over time. In the
      first stage, relationship marketing relies primarily on pricing incentives to encourage new customers to begin a
      relationship with a company. But competing on price leaves a company vulnerable to competitors&apos; moves.
      Marketers seeking lasting relationships must offer more than a price advantage.</p>
    <p class="tx">To create a deeper bond, marketers leverage the reality that service encounters are also social
      encounters. In the second stage marketers encourage personalization and customization of the offering, or at least
      the relationship, to move buyers and sellers toward a social bond. Customer appreciation events, educational
      seminars, and such lead to a friendship that prompts customers to be more tolerant of the occasional failure and
      more resistant to competitors&apos; moves.</p>
    <p class="tx">In the third stage, sellers find a way to solve important customer problems, achieving an even deeper
      level of relationship by bringing buyers and sellers into a partnership that offers benefits difficult to find
      elsewhere. This creates true loyalty. Membership programs, such as those that airlines offer, are an example of
      this third, deepest stage in the relationship (Berry, 1995). Table 7.5 summarizes the deepening levels of the
      buyer&#x2013;seller relationship.</p>

        title="Pile of various rewards credit cards" src="images/7.5.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Associated Press</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">Rewards cards are intended to move customers toward a deeper sense of loyalty to the
        provider through earned savings on hotel stays, airline miles, and guest services.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="tx">Marketing programs that encourage multiple transactions, known as <strong>frequency marketing
        programs</strong>, move customers toward a deepening sense of loyalty through frequent touches via advertising
      or direct mail and promotions that reward repeat purchases. Similar are <strong>affinity marketing
        programs</strong> that leverage customers&apos; ties to institutions and concepts they hold dear (Kurtz, 2010).
      Affinity marketing programs link two brands in a mutually beneficial relationship. Hotels and airlines exploit the
      power of frequency marketing, while colleges and sports teams often use affinity marketing to build relationships.
      When a university teams up with a major bank to offer a credit card bearing the school&apos;s insignia,
      that&apos;s an affinity marketing program. Companies using the &quot;membership economy&quot; model can use
      affinity marketing programs to build loyalty through a sense of community. </p>
    <a id="p251"></a>
    <p class="tx">The data warehouses fundamental to CRM provide the depth of knowledge on which a satisfying
      relationship can be built. The ideal relationship between buyer and seller would be built on face-to-face
      interactions over time. Outside of B2B models (where personal selling dominates), however, that one-to-one
      conversation more typically takes place through individual messaging via outbound variable-printed direct mail or
      variable-content e-mail. Monitoring of the consumers&apos; response (either directly through inquiries and/or
      orders or indirectly through social media) completes the interaction.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec7.5.2">The Prize: Recommendations</h2>
    <p class="tx">The best thing about building long-term relationships is that a company gains not only access to the
      lifetime customer value of each relationship but also more customers from each relationship&apos;s circle of
      influence through the message channel known as buzz, or word of mouth. Individuals&apos; willingness to recommend
      a company or brand is a powerful metric that can be easily obtained simply by asking customers. People&apos;s
      willingness to recommend a product or service to others is a useful barometer for both their advocacy and loyalty.
      People take their own advice&#x2014;those who recommend a brand are also more likely to repurchase it (Samson,
      2006).</p>
    <p class="tx">Buzz marketing is an increasingly popular message channel among marketers. They hope for positive word
      of mouth but must also prepare for the opposite. Negative experiences with a brand have even greater impact on
      loyalty and recommendations than positive experiences; bad buzz persists longer and reaches more people.
      Practicing CRM, marketers work on reducing negative customer experience before it turns into bad buzz.</p>
    <p class="tx">Enhancing customer satisfaction is the key. Marketers carefully monitor what matters to customers and
      what might affect satisfaction with any aspect of the product, brand, or company. To obtain customer feedback,
      companies make themselves accessible through their websites and toll-free phone numbers. To monitor word of mouth,
      they follow social media and blogs and hire mystery shoppers to appraise customer experiences. Proactive methods
      such as customer satisfaction surveys also help companies evaluate how well they&apos;re serving customers and if
      they are earning the ultimate prize of relationship building: recommendations.</p>
    <p class="tx">Marketing campaigns designed to generate buzz have at their core the desire to build relationships
      that generate recommendations, face-to-face or via social media. In 2017 Heineken launched a campaign called Open
      Your World that raised a social issue to generate online mentions of its brand. The brand conducted a sociological
      experiment to bring people together with opposing points of view, such as feminist and antifeminist, and climate
      change activist and denier. The experiment called for them to take part in team-building activities, then reveal
      their political viewpoints. Each pair had an option to share a Heineken and discuss their views following the
      activity&#x2014;and every pair in the experiment agreed to do so. Heineken used Facebook as the campaign&apos;s
      primary platform. In the first month following its launch, the campaign achieved over 50,000 shares (Digital
      Marketing Institute, 2017).</p>

    <p class="tx">To review: In the current relationship or Marketing 3.0 era, companies place great value on
      relationships with customers. Over time these relationships pass through three stages: price focused at the start,
      leading to social bonds through repeated interactions, and hopefully coming to a stage of partnership based on
      solving important customer problems. Each relationship thus built brings not only a lifetime share of
      customers&apos; purchases but also new recommendations through word of mouth, which marketers work to make
      positive rather than negative by delivering customer satisfaction and monitoring what matters to customers. The
      operational result is costs constrained through reduced need for new-customer-acquisition programs, as well as
      satisfied customers retained leading to greater return on marketing investment.</p>

    <h2 class="Case-Study h2" id="ch07casestudy"><strong>Case Study: </strong><em>RC Willey Home Furnishing</em></h2>

    <p class="tx">Rufus Call Willey started selling appliances door-to-door in Syracuse, Utah, in 1932. Fast-forward
      nearly 100 years: RC Willey Home Furnishings (<a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://www.rcwilley.com">http://www.rcwilley.com</a>) has become a Salt Lake City&#x2013;based company
      that operates a dozen retail stores in Utah, Nevada, California, and Idaho. The chain positions itself in a
      competitive, price-conscious field on its deep inventory across five lines (appliances, furniture, electronics,
      sleep products, and flooring), superior delivery, and financing options that include a popular store-brand credit
      card.</p>
    <a id="p253"></a>
    <p class="tx">RC Willey&apos;s marketing strategies focus on targeted direct mail augmented by frequent promotions
      and contests. Traditional advertising has increasingly lost its share of RC Willey&apos;s marketing budget to
      database-driven tactics and digital media.</p>
    <p class="tx">Brenda Hoskins holds the title of digital media buyer and direct marketing, which makes her
      responsible for the company&apos;s database marketing. Hoskins (personal communication, January 15, 2011)
      expressed her enthusiasm for data-driven marketing&apos;s contribution to RC Willey&apos;s bottom line:
      &quot;It&apos;s a phenomenal sales tool. It&apos;s like having two or three extra weeks of sales in every
      year.&quot; Hoskins uses highly targeted trigger marketing campaigns to achieve goals in customer acquisition,
      retention, and reactivation.</p>
    <p class="tx">RC Willey may be approaching its centennial, but its commitment to data-driven marketing is state of
      the art and supported with investment in data warehouse management. Its data warehouse passed 3 million records in
      2012 as the company celebrated its 80th anniversary. Hoskins&apos;s data team has analyzed those customer data,
      assigning each household an <strong>RFM score</strong> based on recency, frequency, and monetary value of past
      purchases. The data team is constantly reviewing the data by different measures&#x2014;for example, sales by
      category, by cluster, or by age&#x2014;looking for opportunities. Hoskins provides updated point-of-sale data to
      her analytics service provider weekly.</p>
    <p class="tx">&quot;Behavior dictates what we want to buy and when we&apos;re going to buy it,&quot; Hoskins
      observed. &quot;A marriage, the birth of a new baby, empty nesting&#x2014;our products are lifestyle-based.&quot;
      Hoskins began using trigger marketing in 2011 based on past behavior to reach households at high-opportunity
      moments with targeted offers matched to recipients&apos; market niches. The first triggers Hoskins deployed
      included the following.</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="bl">new to file</li>
      <li class="bl">one purchase, 90 days elapsed without activity</li>
      <li class="bl">two purchases, 90 days elapsed without activity</li>
      <li class="bl">new mover</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tx">Based on the success of those triggers, Hoskins put in place additional triggers driven by a
      predictive model based on regressive analysis performed on 7 years of point-of-sale data. The model suggests the
      next likely product consumers will buy. For example, people who bought carpeting and motion furniture are likely
      to buy a television next. The additional triggers promoted specific product lines, including the following.</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="bl">bedroom</li>
      <li class="bl">living room</li>
      <li class="bl">motion furniture (recliners, etc.)</li>
      <li class="bl">carpet</li>
      <li class="bl">televisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tx">To constrain the program&apos;s budget, Hoskins mailed to only 5,000 households a month. Three
      specific offers were used, randomly assorted across the mail pieces within product lines. Hoskins used the
      response to calculate which offers were most compelling, always fine-tuning her messages and offers.</p>
    <a id="p254"></a>
    <p class="tx">The vehicle for direct mail to the new-to-file group was &quot;marriage mail,&quot; so termed because
      multiple advertisers&apos; offers are &quot;married&quot; in one package for delivery. Using marriage mail
      provider Valassis allowed Hoskins to reach new prospects at a cost of 4 or 5 cents each with a full-color
      advertising flyer. By using Valassis&apos;s data models to target the marriage mail to households most like
      current customers, Hoskins said, &quot;I know I&apos;m looking for the right customer in the right place.&quot;
    </p>
    <p class="tx">Subsequent trigger mailings used the more expensive technique of solo mail pieces personalized with
      variable data printing. The addressing of the subsequent trigger mails&#x2014;which households should receive them
      and which offers each household should receive&#x2014;is where the sophistication of RC Willey&apos;s data-driven
      marketing program really shines.</p>
    <p class="tx">Customer Analytics, the service provider responsible for RC Willey&apos;s data models, used its
      proprietary lifestyle/life stage segmentation system to append cluster identifiers to RC Willey&apos;s customer
      database to achieve an extremely rich understanding of customers, and then matched the resulting clusters to the
      five RC Willey product lines. &quot;We have identified who our customers are, and then who their lookalikes
      are,&quot; Hoskins explained. Armed with that information, &quot;we sifted our total market and flagged every
      potential customer who had never shopped with us and sent them a very aggressive offer.&quot; Hoskins uses the
      look-alike profile to fine-tune mailing list purchases beyond the ZIP Code level typically used, buying instead at
      the even finer carrier route level. &quot;In a ZIP Code with maybe 10,000 households, I know that to sell
      furniture, I only need to reach certain specific carrier routes&#x2014;so instead of 10,000 households I might
      mail to only 2,000 or 3,000,&quot; Hoskins explained. Every campaign is marked as a specific &quot;event&quot; so
      that at any given time results by customer, by store, by dollars spent, or by RFM score can be calculated.</p>
    <p class="tx">At the time of the interview, RC Willey&apos;s data team had tracked responses and sales from the
      trigger campaigns executed in the first 10 months of 2011. Across all 11 triggers used, 331,077 total pieces were
      mailed. Of those, 7.8 households responded; 13.5% made purchases. &quot;Very interesting to me was the discovery
      that 2,144 customers shopped 3,319 times,&quot; Hoskins said. The total cost of the campaign was 3.4% of the sales
      generated. Based on the success of the initial trigger marketing campaigns, Hoskins planned to double her
      investment in that program in the coming year.</p>
    <p class="tx">In addition to the trigger campaigns, Hoskins is focusing on using contests to build an opt-in
      database of customers and prospects who have agreed to receive e-mails from RC Willey. Customer events are another
      technique used to engage customers. &quot;We held a Sushi Night in our store,&quot; Hoskins said. &quot;I mailed
      out 85,000 invites to three specific clusters. I blocked out the latest two events to ensure I&apos;m talking to a
      rotating customer base.&quot;</p>
    <p class="tx">Using data-driven marketing, RC Willey can engage its customers at least four or five times a year in
      some major store event. And Hoskins can prove the results of her campaigns by a variety of measures&#x2014;RFM
      code, cluster, sales. &quot;We know exactly how much the campaign cost, who responded, and the sales result,&quot;
      she said.</p>
    <p class="tx">RC Willey Home Furnishings is applying leading-edge analytics to the STP approach of segmentation,
      targeting, and positioning. This example of data-driven marketing illustrates marketing strategy driven by

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="bl">Sociocultural influences, degree of involvement, and situational influences are three types of
        factors influencing the consumers&apos; purchase decision process. These factors apply as consumers complete
        five tasks in the purchase decision process. As consumers change, the nuances of this process may change.
        Awareness of the factors influencing buying behavior will always be demanded of marketers.</li>
      <li class="bl">Marketers study consumer behavior, motivation, and emotions to understand how buyers see the world,
        how they make selections, and how to position offerings effectively.</li>
      <li class="bl">The STP approach is widely used by marketers, requiring familiarity with and application of the
        nine criteria for effective segmentation discussed in Section 7.3.</li>
      <li class="bl">The CRM philosophy brings together data collected across an organization to align a company around
        customers. Insights from those data help marketers execute the STP approach effectively, as the example of
        Calluniverse segmenting its customers on revenue and access share demonstrated.</li>
      <li class="bl">Buyer&#x2013;seller relationships pass through three stages, beginning with a focus on price,
        progressing to social bonds through interactions, and evolving into a valued partnership based on solving
        problems. Each relationship brings a share of customers&apos; purchases over time and, if all goes well, new
        relationships through recommendations.</li>

    <h1 class="h1" id="ch08intro">Introduction</h1>

    <p class="tx">Marketers must anticipate and plan for the many external factors influencing their strategic
      decisions. Of concern are not only the factors at work at the current moment, but also changes coming over the
      horizon&#x2014;no small challenge!</p>

    <p class="tx">Even though external forces are beyond marketers&#x2019; control, any business decision maker must
      still take those influences into account in developing the marketing mix. Now that you have studied product,
      price, place, and promotion, you are prepared to consider the impact of <em>actors</em> and <em>forces</em> in the
      environment on the strategic decisions of the marketing mix.</p>

    <p class="tx">A note about terms: To avoid confusion between the <em>marketing environment</em> and the <em>natural
      </em><em>environment</em>, throughout this chapter the words <em>ecology</em>/<em>ecological</em> and
      <em>nature</em>/<em>natural</em> have been used to refer to the latter concept.</p>

    <p class="tx">All companies are surrounded by pressures deriving from people (actors) and the dynamics of the
      current situation (forces). These actors and forces exert pressures on both the micro environment (factors
      specifically affecting one company) and the macro environment (factors affecting many companies). These influences
      create both opportunities and threats for any company. Table 8.1 depicts the relationships between these factors
      in the marketing environment.</p>

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note</em>. Marketers must anticipate and plan for the influence of actors and forces
      on a company&#x2019;s micro and macro environment as they develop the marketing mix.</p>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Actors</strong> in the micro environment include the individuals who affect the
      company&#x2019;s ability to serve its customers. In this group are a company&#x2019;s close
      allies&#x2014;stakeholders such as management groups, employees, board members, stockholders, and
      suppliers&#x2014;as well as competitors and various publics. Customers also play a role in the micro environment,
      through their consumer behavior and their participation in the public conversation about the company in social
      media and elsewhere. As part of the trend toward cocreation, customers are serving on advisory boards and being
      invited into innovation efforts, increasing their importance as actors in the micro environment.</p>

      <p class="photo-caption">Small changes in behavior can have far-ranging effects, as illustrated by the quinoa
        example in the text. Can you think of any other examples?</p>
    </div>

    <a id="p261"></a>
    <p class="tx">In the macro environment are larger societal <strong>forces</strong> and actors with widespread
      influence. Increasing globalization is bringing forces from around the world into play. While a butterfly flapping
      its wings in Brazil is unlikely to affect markets in Burma or Boston, small changes in consumer, business, or
      governmental behavior can have far-ranging effects. For example, as described in Chapter 1, the increasing
      consumption of quinoa in the United States as a health food has led to negative health consequences in the South
      American countries where it is grown. Companies must consider not only the potential markets beyond national
      borders but also the interconnected effects of actors and forces in many countries.</p>


    <p class="tx">Toward what end do marketers study actors and forces in the marketing environment? In a word,
      <em>planning</em>. In Chapter 2 you learned that research provides the essential inputs to strategic planning.
      Analysis of environmental actors and forces contributes to the first step in the marketing process. There can be
      no selection of a marketing strategy, development of a campaign, or execution and measurement without this crucial
      step.</p>

    <p class="tx">Micro- and macro-environmental forces make up the focus of study in this chapter. We&#x2019;ll begin
      with a look at the actors in the micro environment. Upcoming sections in this chapter address macro-environmental
      forces, including sociocultural factors, technological and ecological factors, and economic, political, and legal
      factors.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.1.1">Actors in the Micro Environment</h2>

    <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s examine the actors in the micro environment:</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Company groups:</em> Employees form groups within a company, charged with carrying out its
      objectives and strategic plans. Important groups to consider include top management, finance, research and
      development (R&amp;D), purchasing, operations, and accounting. Employees as individuals are also actors in their
      employer company&#x2019;s micro environment. In a company with a marketing orientation, individuals in every
      functional role must work together to deliver value to customers.</p>

    <a id="p262"></a>
    <p class="tx">Members of an incorporated firm&#x2019;s board of directors set policy, oversee control procedures,
      and govern the firm while looking after its investors&#x2019; interests. Members of this company group may include
      both the firm&#x2019;s top management and experts or respected persons drawn from the firm&#x2019;s community.</p>

    <p class="tx">Channel partners form another company group. Suppliers, distributors, and resellers are critical to a
      company&#x2019;s overall ability to deliver customer value. When channel partners have problems, they can affect
      the other partners&#x2019; performance.</p>

    <p class="tx">Since marketers strive to align company stakeholders with the goal of building long-term customer
      relationships, shifts in the makeup of the board, management, employee force, or channel partners can affect
      marketing strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Competitors:</em> Marketing-oriented companies are constantly engaged in monitoring competitors in
      their environment. Successful positioning would be impossible without knowledge of competitors&#x2019; strategies
      and trends.</p>

    <p class="tx">Influencing the competitive environment are factors such as each firm&#x2019;s position in the
      industry structure (leader, challenger, etc.), the size and number of competitors, and the degree to which
      competition focuses on price. Also influential is each competitor&#x2019;s mission, strategic motivations, and
      attitude&#x2014;leader? underdog?&#x2014;factors that foretell likely responses to each other&#x2019;s strategic
      moves.</p>

    <p class="tx">Product issues also affect the competitive environment, including indirect competition from
      substitutes and direct competitors&#x2019; strategies regarding their offerings&#x2019; branding, quality, price,
      and degrees of service and support. In addition, the relation of supply to demand in the marketplace, and trends
      that might predict change in supply and demand, are part of the competitive landscape.</p>

    <p class="tx">In addition to the threat of moves by existing competitors, marketers must monitor the entry of new
      competitors. Technological innovation by a competitor could change demand for a company&#x2019;s products or
      services radically and quickly. For example, e-mail replaced much of the traffic in local delivery of documents;
      digital photography made film processing unnecessary.</p>

    <p class="tx">Finally, few industries are safe from foreign competitors. Most businesses face some risk of losing
      their home market to a foreign company with aggressive plans for expansion.</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Publics:</em> In the micro environment are groups with an interest in or impact on an
      organization. Publics include financial communities, government and citizen-action groups, and the general
      population with an interest in the locale or industry of a company. Most important among the publics are those
      intent on spreading communications&#x2014;the media, including news, features, and editorial opinion platforms,
      and the commentators who, through blogs and other channels, share their opinions widely. Any or all of these
      publics can create good or bad word of mouth and thus require monitoring and relationship management.</p>

    <a id="p263"></a>
    <p class="tx"><em>Customer markets:</em> Customer markets can be consumer (buying goods and services for personal
      consumption), business (buying for use in production of other goods and services), resellers (retailers and others
      buying for resale at a profit), or government (buying to produce public services or provide goods or services to
      those in need of them). Customer markets influence companies through their structure, which determines the size of
      the customer base and the aggregate buying power available to a company. Each structure has distinct
      characteristics that will affect marketing strategy and thus needs close observation to detect trends that might
      call for shifts in strategic direction.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.1.2">Environmental Scanning</h2>

    <p class="tx">Knowledge of the micro and macro environment must come from somewhere. Marketers&#x2019; research
      designed to collect information about the external marketing environment in order to identify and interpret
      potential trends is known as <strong>environmental scanning</strong>. Conducting an environmental scan is part of
      the strategic analysis phase of the marketing process, as discussed in Chapter 2. Environmental scanning is
      typically conducted by the marketing department&#x2019;s research team.</p>

    <p class="tx">Environmental scanning is used to understand forces that may affect a company&#x2019;s strategic
      plans, such as competitors&#x2019; moves. Environmental scanning brings to light trends a company&#x2019;s
      marketers would otherwise be unable to sense.</p>

    <p class="tx">The process of environmental scanning serves three goals:</p>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">to provide an understanding of current and potential changes in the environment</li>
      <li class="bl">to provide important intelligence for strategic decision makers</li>
      <li class="bl">to facilitate strategic thinking at every level in the organization</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Environmental scanning is a wide-ranging activity encompassing everything a company does to keep
      abreast of developments in the wider environment that may affect its future. Effective environmental scanning
      requires maximum exposure to the widest possible range of media, customer conversations, and thought leaders in
      the industry, region, and political/governmental sphere (Mercer, 1998).</p>

    <p class="tx">One form environmental scanning takes is the pursuit of <strong>competitive intelligence</strong>.
      Researchers gather information about all aspects of competitors&#x2019; marketing and business activities. Another
      form is <strong>market sensing</strong>&#x2014;the pursuit of information about customers&#x2019; behaviors,
      preferences, and motivations.</p>

    <p class="tx">Every marketer hopes to predict trends ahead of competitors. The holy grail of environmental scanning
      is to detect <strong>weak signals</strong>&#x2014;the first signs of an emerging development in any of the
      environmental forces. Paradoxically, weak signals have the most strategic value when they are weakest&#x2014;like
      the first dark cloud that warns of an approaching thunderstorm. Furthermore, it can be hard to weed out irrelevant
      weak signals and to properly interpret the relevant ones. Even so, weak signals are such an important source of
      competitive advantage that wise marketers develop market sensing programs specifically designed to detect them.
    </p>

    <a id="p264"></a>
    <p class="tx">The use of customer advisory panels is one example of marketers attempting to pick up weak signals
      about shifts in customer preferences or behavior. Another is careful &#x201C;listening&#x201D; to customers on
      social media platforms. When Nordstrom began noticing that its Pinterest followers were putting together virtual
      &#x201C;wish lists,&#x201D; the retailer began reflecting those choices in actual product groupings in its
      physical and online stores, using those weak signals from customers to increase product sales (Brown, 2013). </p>

    <p class="tx">Perhaps the most dramatic trend an environmental scan would pick up today is the striking increase in
      customer-generated information available about competing options to fill specific needs or desires. Marketers must
      respond strategically to be sure the differentiating features and benefits of their offerings are part of the
      conversation or risk being forced to compete primarily on price.</p>

    <div class="box-2">
      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 8.1: </strong><em>Customer-Generated Product Information</em></h1>
      <p class="tx">How much customer-generated information is available about competing consumer product options?
        Consider rotisserie ovens as a product category. Visit Amazon.com, Walmart.com, or another major
        retailer&#x2019;s website and enter &#x201C;rotisserie oven&#x201D; in the search field. Choose one of the top
        listings in your search results and look for customer reviews. How many do you find?</p>
      <p class="tx">Have you ever posted or sought customer-generated information? Why?</p>
      <p class="tx">If you were marketing rotisserie ovens, how might you use this information?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">In summary, marketers must anticipate and plan for the influence of actors (people, either
      individually or in groups) and forces (situational factors) on a company&#x2019;s micro and macro environment as
      they develop their marketing strategy. The primary tool by which they understand these influences is environmental
      scanning.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Consider a manufacturer of vinyl records today. What would an environmental scan pick up regarding
        future demand for the company&#x2019;s products? How might environmental factors&#x2014;such as the music
        industry&#x2019;s search for a revenue source that doesn&#x2019;t lend itself to illegal downloads,
        consumers&#x2019; dissatisfaction with the relatively poor sound fidelity of MP3 audio files, or indie
        retailers&#x2019; and musicians&#x2019; embrace of the vinyl format&#x2014;affect demand for vinyl records? How
        would these trends be classified in our schema of micro-environmental actors and macro-environmental forces?</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec8.2">8.2&#x2002;Social and Cultural Factors</h1>

    <div class="photo-right">
      <img id="img8.2" class="scaled" alt="Family camping." title="Family camping." src="images/8.2.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Kali9/E+/Getty</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">U.S. consumers have become more interested in time with family and friends and living
        sustainable lifestyles, an example of cultural factors influencing consumer purchasing behavior.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Social and cultural forces in the marketing environment guide business practices and purchasing
      behavior. People typically absorb the worldview of the community they are raised in, including the dominant values
      and modes of behavior. Core societal beliefs, like the dominant U.S. belief in the value of work and family, are
      passed from generation to generation and reinforced by institutions such as schools and churches.</p>

    <a id="p265"></a>
    <p class="tx">Core beliefs and values are firmly ingrained and resistant to change. Marketers can hope to influence
      how some people act on those beliefs but find it is more difficult to fundamentally change them. That is the
      challenge presented by social marketing, discussed in Chapter 3. Shifts in social and cultural factors represent
      opportunities for competitive advantage for the firms that sense them early enough and develop strategic
      responses.</p>

    <p class="tx">Of tremendous interest in the sociocultural environment is the generational cohort known as the
      millennials, so termed because the first of the millennial cohort would have graduated from high school in 2000.
      As was mentioned in Chapter 7, the millennial cohort is the largest in U.S. history and is estimated to have the
      most spending power of any generation (Frey, 2016). In a 2016 article titled &#x201C;The Myth of the Millennial as
      Cultural Rebel,&#x201D; <em>New Republic</em> editor Laura Marsh challenges current interpretations of millennial
      behavior. She calls out what appears to be &#x201C;cultural rebellion&#x201D; as accommodation to the fact that
      millennials would be the first cohort in U.S. history to experience a lower standard of living than their parents.
      &#x201C;Do we use Zipcar because we are ideologically committed to sharing, or because car ownership is out of
      reach for a lot of people. . . ? Does a married couple decide to live with roommates because of our generational
      &#x2018;openness to communal living&#x2019; or because people in New York face impossible rents?&#x201D; Marsh
      asks. She suggests that when headlines tout &#x201C;Millennials are killing the X industry,&#x201D; we should
      substitute &#x201C;Millennials are locked out of the X industry.&#x201D; They may have significant spending power
      as a group, but divided by their large numbers, individually that spending seems pinched. This is worth
      remembering as you learn about this cohort&#x2019;s outsized influence on today&#x2019;s market environment
      (Marsh, 2016). </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.2.1">Cultural Values</h2>

    <p class="tx">In Chapter 7 we discussed how cultural factors influence consumer purchasing behavior. In addition, as
      U.S. consumers become increasingly humanity-centric (part of the trend Kotler labeled Marketing 3.0), we are
      seeing greater value placed on time with family and friends; sustainable lifestyles; ecologically friendly
      purchase, consumption, and disposal of goods; and decreased materialism balanced by increased search for inner
      purpose (Kotler &amp; Armstrong, 2006).</p>

    <p class="tx">Expressing humanity-centric values is the <strong>consumerism movement</strong>, an organized effort
      by individuals, groups, and governments to protect the consumer by exerting moral, legal, and economic pressures
      on business and government. The movement works to protect and inform consumers by advocating for honesty in
      packaging and advertising and improved safety standards for products and services. Laws are the main tool for
      compliance.</p>

    <a id="p266"></a>
    <p class="tx">These trends reflecting values of consumers are relevant to marketers because people express their
      values through their purchasing behavior. Buyers favor products and services that support their values,
      self-image, and societal concerns.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.2.2">Demographics</h2>

    <p class="tx">Changes in the demographic environment have major implications for marketers, since the people studied
      in aggregate by demographers are the same people who as individuals are consumers of marketers&#x2019; goods and
      services. Demography is the study of human populations in terms of their quantifiable socioeconomic
      characteristics such as age, education level, income level, marital status, occupation, religion, birthrate, death
      rate, family composition, and more. As you learned in Chapter 7, marketers study demographics and other
      descriptors of populations, such as psychographics, life stage/lifestyle, and purchase behavior, to segment
      markets and position offerings to appeal to target niches.</p>

    <p class="tx">The cohort effect, discussed in Chapter 7, has proved helpful to marketers eager to tailor appeals and
      offerings to each generation&#x2019;s tastes. Global marketers have also discovered that many of the American
      generational differences also exist outside the United States (Paul, 2002). Thus, generational cohorts as a market
      segmentation tool can be assumed to retain their validity even as immigration contributes to population growth.

      <p class="photo-caption">How do demographic factors affect marketers?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">But viewing the marketplace through the prism of age-based cohorts has its limitations. The greatest
      danger is oversimplification. A 40-something woman may be a grandmother or a new mom. People of identical ages can
      hold a wide variety of attitudes, motivations, and behaviors. They can attain different educational levels and
      belong to different social classes, causing them to have radically different outlooks. One need look no further
      than the divisive political climate following the election of Donald Trump to understand this. </p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.2.3">A Changing America</h2>

    <p class="tx">In 2016 the Pew Research Center identified 10 demographic trends shaping the United States and the
      world beyond its borders. The trends most relevant to U.S. marketers are as follows.</p>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Increasing racial and ethnic diversity: By the year 2055 no single racial/ethnic category will be
        the majority.</li>
      <li class="bl">More diverse family/household types: Declining marriage rates, divorce, remarriage, and
        cohabitation have created blended families, in which the roles of mothers and fathers are less gender specified
        than in the past.</li>
      <li class="bl">An aging population in both the United States and abroad: As a result of rapidly rising birthrates
        from 1950 to 2010, followed by birthrates projected to slow significantly from 2010 to 2050, the world&#x2019;s
        population will soon tilt toward the older age group (Cohn &amp; Caumont, 2016). </li>
    </ul>

    <a id="p267"></a>
    <p class="tx">As a result of these trends, marketers are likely to find more opportunity in niche markets as the
      population becomes more diverse. Marketing campaigns will need to reflect the diversity of those niches, and
      opportunities for industries and companies that serve older adults will likely increase&#x2014;for example, a
      growth market for lifelong learning and experiences like Road Scholar, formerly named Elderhostel (Wellner, 2004)
    </p>

    <p class="tx">&#x201C;No household type neatly describes even one-third of households,&#x201D; writes Peter Francese
      (as cited in Johnson, 2009, para. 9), a demographic trends analyst for WPP Ogilvy &amp; Mather, New York. </p>

    <p class="tx">Once, the popular metaphor for the American population was the melting pot. Today&#x2019;s observers
      are more likely to use the phrase &#x201C;salad bowl,&#x201D; recognizing that various cultures are tossed
      together like salad ingredients, without merging their flavors into one homogeneous culture. Beginning with the
      U.S. 2000 census, 63 possible combinations of the six basic racial categories exist, including six categories for
      those who report exactly one race, and 57 categories for those who report two or more races. The racial categories
      offered by the U.S. Census Bureau since 2000 include American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African
      American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, and Some Other Race.</p>

    <p class="tx">The fundamental insight for marketers revealed by these recent demographic trends is that segmentation
      by any demographic attribute is most effective when paired with segmentation by behavioral data. Categorizing
      prospective consumers by what they <em>do</em> rather than who they <em>are</em> leads to more effective
      marketing.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.2.4">Marketers Respond to Sociocultural Changes</h2>

    <p class="tx">Marketers are responding to the increasing diversity of U.S. consumers by developing marketing
      strategies that focus on non-White consumers. Marketers can target the subsegments within market niches, such as
      the different nationalities of Latinos (e.g., Mexican, Guatemalan), and develop multicultural campaigns that
      include many nationalities. &#x201C;Instead of thinking of discrete segments in a multicultural world,
      we&#x2019;re saying the new reality is that it&#x2019;s more of a cross-cultural world, a mash-up of
      cultures,&#x201D; says John Seifer (as cited in Elliott, 2011d), chair and chief executive of Ogilvy &amp; Mather
      North America.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers are also requiring more in-depth market research, relying on techniques like <strong>retail
        ethnography</strong> that enable them to understand other cultures more deeply, absorbing differences in
      communication styles, behavior, and lifestyles that affect spending behaviors (Wellner, 2004). We discussed
      research (including ethnography) in more detail in Chapter 2.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketers&#x2019; response to environmental trends in society and culture going forward will likely be
      based on their application of the insights of Marketing 3.0. As stated in Chapter 1, three major forces are
      affecting work among today&#x2019;s consumers:</p>
    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">demand for participation</li>
      <li class="nl">anxiety about globalization</li>
      <li class="nl">an increasingly creative society</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx"><em>Demand for participation: </em>New niches that share common values and passions often form into
      tight-knit communities. <em>Beehiving</em> (as this trend has been termed) describes small groups that give their
      members a sense of connection and belonging. To reach these communities, marketers are using more techniques like
      experiential marketing that strengthen connections between like-minded individuals and the companies that fill
      their wants and needs. Experiential marketing, characterized by live encounters between brands and consumers that
      create memorable experiences, fills consumers&#x2019; demand for participation. The trend toward smaller, more
      intimate bricks-and-mortar shops, along with intimate showrooms within large stores&#x2014;places where customer
      service and experience are emphasized over breadth of the merchandise assortment&#x2014;exemplifies this response
      to shifts in the sociocultural environment (Hsu, 2017).</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Anxiety about globalization: </em>Consumers&#x2019; anxiety requires a marketing response that is
      authentic and driven by recognition that financial profit cannot take priority over social or environmental
      impact. Companies show their alignment with these values through their ethical conduct, corporate social
      responsibility policies, and occasionally through cause-related marketing campaigns (Mish &amp; Scammon, 2010).
      When Starbucks ramped up its expansion in China (described in Chapter 6), it addressed anxiety about globalization
      both in China and in its home market by providing good wages and benefits and by creating hundreds of jobs through
      local sourcing of its coffee beans. </p>

    <p class="tx"><em>An increasingly creative society:</em> To address market niches of creative people in search of
      self-actualization, marketers are beginning to use segmentation strategies based more on activities and affinities
      than age classifications. Marketers design experiences that reflect targeted communities&#x2019; customs and
      language to build trust and engagement (Wellner, 2004). Inviting customers into cocreation of value&#x2014;an
      inherently creative act&#x2014;is an increasingly effective response to this sociocultural trend. Consider Nike+,
      a website and app where runners create community around their shared interest. Uploading data about runs allows
      them to see their exercise progress day-by-day, map their routes, share that information with their community of
      fellow runners, and even invite others to upcoming runs. Nike gets valuable customer data, while customers get a
      motivating social fitness experience&#x2014;a classic win-win (Towers, 2011). </p>

    <a id="p269"></a>
    <p class="tx">In conclusion, the environmental trends in social and cultural factors affecting consumers are driven
      by changing demographics, including overall population growth, an increasing number of older adults, and an
      increase in ethnic/racial diversity. A more fine-grained look at the data reveals that generalizations about the
      U.S. population are less useful than ever before, as the population becomes more of a &#x201C;patchwork
      nation.&#x201D;</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider </strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">With the increasing diversity of the U.S. population, marketers can either target the subsegments
        within market niches or take aim at multiple ethnic segments. Think of a product or service you buy regularly.
        Suggest two STP (segmenting, targeting, and positioning) strategies for that offering, one based on targeting a
        subsegment and the other using a multicultural approach.</p>
    </div>


    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec8.3">8.3&#x2002;Technological and Ecological Factors</h1>

    <p class="tx">Among the societal forces in the environment capable of influencing a company&#x2019;s marketing
      strategy are developments in technology and ecology, which can sometimes be in conflict. Let&#x2019;s consider
      each and how they interact.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.3.1">Technology: Always a Game Changer </h2>

    <p class="tx">Changes in the technological environment have had dramatic effects. For businesses, computer
      technology has created major opportunities in developing and distributing equipment, systems, and training in how
      to use them. For consumers, advances in health care technology have contributed to increased longevity and quality
      of life, while advances in technology for education, information, and entertainment have revolutionized how we
      study, work, and play.</p>

    <p class="tx">Every new technology replaces an older technology, creating new markets and opportunities for some
      businesses while hurting others that have not kept up with changes in the technological environment. Not only do
      technological innovations bring us new products we didn&#x2019;t know we wanted, they improve existing products we
      use every day. Advances in technology also reduce prices to consumers through improvements in production and
      distribution methods that cut costs in the supply chain. Innovations in technology for communications and data
      management make better customer service possible.</p>

    <p class="tx">New technology emerges from the R&amp;D departments of private industry, as well as government and the
      military, the research centers of colleges and universities, and not-for-profit institutions. A marketer&#x2019;s
      environmental scanning for technology trends must cover all these possible sources of innovation. Companies that
      fail to sense or dismiss coming technological change put themselves at risk. Consider the strategic position of
      the producers of the Sony Walkman or the <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em> today.</p>

    <a id="p270"></a>
    <p class="tx">A recent trend to capture the public&#x2019;s attention is technology that learns for
      itself&#x2014;referred to by terms like artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive computing, and machine learning.
      Improvements in natural language processing and speech recognition (two technologies that make it easier for
      computers to learn) are driving rapid advances in how the computers around us adapt to our needs, whether that
      means Alexa ordering products from Amazon at our spoken command or a driverless car arriving to take us to our
      next destination (Nour, 2017). AI is expected to become embedded in many other technologies where it will make
      decisions for humans, or help us make decisions&#x2014;for example, helping doctors diagnose diseases. Also
      generating buzz are virtual/augmented reality (used both for entertainment and business purposes) and robotics.
      This field has given us aerial drones and autonomous vehicles; we are likely to see increased use of robotics in a
      wide range of business-specific applications in the future (Business Wire, 2017). </p>

    <div class="photo-right">

      <p class="credit">Claudiodivizia/iStock/Getty Images Plus</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">Companies that fail to discern technological trends risk obsolescence, as happened with
        the hugely popular Sony Walkman when MP3 players were introduced.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Another way of framing &#x201C;the ones to watch&#x201D; in the technology environment is
      &#x201C;SMAC&#x201D;&#x2014;an abbreviation for &#x201C;social, mobile, analytics, cloud.&#x201D; Each technology
      is driving change, and companies that leverage convergences between them, like cloud storage of photos taken with
      mobile devices, are already thriving. Separately and together, these technologies will be drivers of entirely new
      industries and business models (Copeland &amp; Om, 2005). </p>

    <p class="tx">Companies that harness these technologies to support their customers&#x2019; journeys&#x2014;without
      requiring those customers to change their behaviors&#x2014;will more successfully navigate the disruptions ahead
      as these technologies transform our world. </p>

    <p class="tx">Not only does new technology promise opportunity for marketers to create new points of competitive
      difference, it holds the promise for benefits to society. But at what price? While technology seems unlimited in
      its potential to aid businesses and culture, the ecological systems we all share have demonstrable limits. Too
      often, technological advances come at an ecological cost.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.3.2">Ecology: A Limited Resource</h2>

    <p class="tx">Natural limitations, and consumers&#x2019; attitudes and motivations driven by awareness of those
      limitations, are factors in the marketing environment that demand marketers&#x2019; attention. Several trends are
      cause for growing concern:</p>
    <a id="p271"></a>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">depletion of nonrenewable resources, such as oil and minerals</li>
      <li class="bl">increased pollution of air, water, and soil</li>
      <li class="bl">destruction of habitats needed to provide food and preserve species</li>
      <li class="bl">potential for radical climate change due to global warming</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">An <em>American Demographics</em> report identified growing population as one of the major
      sociocultural trends and predicts escalating conflicts over local land use, pitting population benefits against
      ecological costs. As a result, the environmental impact of products and services may be scrutinized more closely
      in the future (Wellner, 2004).</p>

    <p class="tx">The degree to which governments intervene in natural resource management should be part of
      marketers&#x2019; environmental scanning. In the United States the Environmental Protection Agency sets and
      enforces pollution standards. The governments of some other nations, like Germany, enforce stringent regulations
      to safeguard natural resources. But developing nations, lacking the needed funds, political will, or both,
      typically do less about pollution and resource protection. Environmentalists fear that companies move
      opportunities to where regulation is lax (Kotler &amp; Armstrong, 2006).</p>

    <p class="tx">Weather is another aspect of ecology that matters to marketers. Weather-related phenomena can affect
      producers, distributors, and/or consumers. Weather can destroy crops, alter transportation patterns, and disrupt
      markets, as was seen following the hurricanes of 2017 that impacted the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and Puerto Rico.
      While profound social consequences occur from such events, for businesses there may be upsides as well as
      downsides&#x2014;generators and other emergency supplies experience high demand during weather-related disasters.
      Demand for construction materials surges once recovery begins.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.3.3">Going &#x201C;Green&#x201D;</h2>



    <p class="tx">Businesses and individuals have responded to ecological concerns with an increasing emphasis on
      &#x201C;green&#x201D; (environmentally sustainable) products and practices. Jeans maker Levi Strauss realized that
      world water shortages could threaten its existence if growing and manufacturing cotton became too expensive due to
      water scarcity. The company has helped underwrite a nonprofit program to teach farmers in India, Pakistan, Brazil,
      and West and Central Africa cutting-edge irrigation and rainwater-capture techniques. Levi Strauss understands
      that its consumers like to see themselves as agents of change. The company sews labels into its jeans urging
      customers to wash less and only in cold water (Kaufman, 2011). Levi Strauss is leveraging both its own production
      processes and its customer relationships to improve the sustainability of its business model.</p>



    <p class="tx">Consumers can also put pressure on businesses to adopt sustainable practices. At the supermarket
      checkout, shoppers&#x2019; growing awareness of the ecological impact of their behavior caused retailers to adapt.
      The question &#x201C;paper or plastic?&#x201D; is now often preceded by &#x201C;did you bring your own
      bags?&#x201D;&#x2014;a more nature-friendly choice.</p>

    <p class="tx">Long-term changes in the natural environment also deserve consideration, such as deforestation,
      dwindling water resources, and climate change. If/when these changes increase in severity, their impact on society
      will affect the market for many goods and services.</p>

    <a id="p272"></a>
    <div class="photo-left">
      <img id="img8.5" class="scaled" alt="Coltan miners in Africa." title="Coltan miners in Africa."
        src="images/8.5.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Associated Press</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">The resources needed for technology products can raise ecological concerns, as seen with
        the increased production of coltan. To meet demands, mining companies have turned to illegal and exploitive
        practices.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.3.4">Technology and Ecology: A Delicate Balance</h2>

    <p class="tx">Technological and ecological concerns are related, in that resources needed for one can affect the
      other. Procurement of raw materials, manufacturing processes, or disposal of technology can affect the natural
      environment. For example, the demand for cell phones and computer chips is driving demand for an ore called
      columbite-tantalite, or coltan; miners all over the world have increased production. But the high demand for the
      ore has created illegal exploitation of natural resources and human populations in African countries (Essick,
      2001).</p>

    <p class="tx">If you own an outdated personal computer or cell phone, you may be part of an ecological
      problem&#x2014;or part of the solution. Electronic devices containing metals, plastics, glass, and chemicals can
      be harmful if discarded in a landfill (or worse) but beneficial if recycled for potential profit (Still, 2008). As
      of early 2018, no federal regulation mandates recycling of technology waste. There have been numerous attempts to
      develop a federal law, but no consensus on a federal approach has emerged. Many states have instituted mandatory
      electronics recovery programs. The video in <em>Field Trip 8.3</em> provides additional information about e-waste
      recycling.</p>

    <div class="box-2">
      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 8.3: </strong><em>Impacts of Technology Waste</em></h1>

      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Research and development of new technological innovations is frequently aimed at solving ecological
      problems and reducing demand on scarce resources. Automakers are developing vehicles with increased fuel
      efficiency and decreased harmful emissions. Corporations use communications technology, such as videoconferencing
      and secure file sharing, to increase telecommuting and thus reduce the number of miles driven by their employees
      as well as office space requirements.</p>

    <a id="p273"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.3.5">Marketers Respond to Technological and Ecological Factors</h2>

    <p class="tx">A technology trend with vast impact on marketers is <em>media convergence</em>, first introduced in
      Chapter 6. Content once delivered through newspapers, magazines, books, radio, and television is converging onto
      the Internet. Meanwhile, the screens on which that content is viewed are multiplying, with consumers choosing
      tablet computers, smartphones, laptops, or desktop computers at different times and places throughout their
      media-consuming days (Enoch &amp; Johnson, 2010). Marketers are responding with a <strong>cross-channel
        approach</strong>, creating experiences that engage with consumers across digital, broadcast, and physical
      experiences. In a convergent-media environment, marketers need to coordinate traditional media, experiential
      marketing, and digital content to convey branded messages and encourage dialogue. </p>

    <p class="tx">Related to this trend is the rise of online marketing, especially on social media platforms, as a
      subspecialty within the marketing field. The result is rapidly expanding employment opportunity. Digital marketing
      is among the skill sets in highest demand; research by McKinley Marketing Partners (a staffing agency) found that
      90% of marketing roles required experience and skill in digital marketing or analytics (Allen, 2016). </p>

    <p class="tx">The green consumerism trend dovetails with much that has been discussed in this book about the
      humanity-centric consumer of the Marketing 3.0 era. Many individuals want to contribute to sustaining and
      improving the world, and they expect the companies they patronize to do the same. Research suggests that
      consumers&#x2019; willingness to pay more for ecology-friendly products and services varies across demographic
      groups. Different groups tend to be concerned about different environmental issues and benefits. For example,
      those who are worried about resource waste appreciate the reduction in both packaging and the energy to
      manufacture it. Those interested in health benefits may be more concerned about pesticide-free products. Marketers
      are using research insights to tailor product development and marketing messages to respond to specific
      niches&#x2019; concerns (Royne, Levy, &amp; Martinez, 2011).</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider </strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Apply the statement &#x201C;Every new technology replaces an older technology, creating new markets
        and opportunities for some businesses while hurting others&#x201D; to smart home devices like Amazon&#x2019;s
        Echo. What markets have been created, and what businesses have been hurt?&#xA0;How?</p>

      <p class="tx">Consider also the statement &#x201C;Technological advances come at an ecological cost.&#x201D; What
        are the demands on the natural environment from smart home devices? Consider their manufacture, use, and
        disposal.</p>
    </div>


    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec8.4">8.4&#x2002;Economic and Political/Legal Factors</h1>

    <p class="tx">Among the societal forces affecting marketers are economic trends and political/legal developments. An
      economy consists of a network of producers, distributors, and consumers of goods and services, operating in the
      context of a local, regional, national, or global community. In that community environment are political
      factors&#x2014;government actions that affect the operations of companies. When government actions take the form
      of laws and regulations, those environmental concerns are not just political&#x2014;they&#x2019;re legal as well.
      Ignorance or defiance of laws can be prosecutable offenses.</p>

    <a id="p274"></a>
    <p class="tx">Business owners and managers continuously scan the economic environment to assess its impact on
      consumers, competitors, distribution channel members, and the organization. They scan the political/legal
      environment to judge how government actions will affect their company. A closer look at each follows.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.4.1">Economic Effects</h2>

    <p class="tx">The <strong>economic environment</strong> refers to factors in the macro environment that affect
      consumer purchasing power and spending patterns. Economic environments vary greatly among nations and even within
      regions.</p>

    <p class="tx">Economies typically cycle through stages of prosperity, recession or depression, and recovery. During
      times of prosperity, conditions of relatively low unemployment lead to high purchasing power. Businesses enjoy an
      environment ripe for new products and expanding distribution.</p>

    <p class="tx"><strong>Recessions</strong> (periods of economic decline typically lasting about six months to a year)
      are marked by high unemployment, stagnant wages, and weak retail sales. Consumers focus on basics, skip
      nonessentials, and trade down to lower priced substitutes for their necessary purchases.</p>

    <p class="tx">If a recession lingers unresolved, the period may be classified as a <strong>depression</strong>,
      characterized by persistently low purchasing power, widespread unemployment, more supply than demand, falling or
      stagnant prices and wages, and general lack of confidence in the future. A depression causes a drop in
      <em>all</em> economic activity.</p>

    <p class="tx">During <strong>recovery</strong>, employment and output begin to rise to their normal levels again.
      The shift from downturn toward prosperity can be tricky for buyers and sellers. Consumers may have rising income
      and thus money to spend again, but they may tend toward cautious behavior based on recent experience. Businesses
      struggle to earn profits on uncertain customer demand.</p>

    <p class="tx">Other economic factors less directly tied to economic stages include the following:</p>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><em>Inflation: </em>A sustained and rapid increase in prices that outpaces wages, mirrored by
        decreasing purchasing power.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Deflation:</em> The opposite of inflation, characterized by falling prices and wages, decrease
        in availability of credit, and decrease in imports due to lack of demand. Deflation always results in lower
        employment and output.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Changes in income:</em> Income affects consumers&#x2019; purchasing power. <strong>Gross
          income</strong> comprises the total yearly earnings of a household or business. Household income is usually
        divided into disposable and discretionary components. <strong>Disposable income</strong> goes to necessities of
        food, shelter, clothing, and transportation. <strong>Discretionary income</strong> is spent on
        &#x201C;luxury&#x201D; items, although defining what is necessary and what is a luxury can be problematic.
        Changes in gross income affect discretionary spending more than disposable spending (Kerin et al., 2009).</li>
    </ul>

    <a id="p275"></a>
    <p class="tx">Changes in these factors have a large effect on consumers and therefore on businesses as well.</p>

      <p class="credit">Image Source/Getty Images</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">Changes in resource availability can arise from unexpected quarters, as happened when
        feathered hair accessories became fashionable, causing the supply of feathers used by fly fishers to decrease.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Changes in resource availability also affect consumption. Shortages cause people to stockpile, find
      alternatives, or do without. During shortages, marketers often allocate limited supplies, as T-shirt distributors
      do when major sporting events create sudden surges in demand that outpace inventories. Another option is to
      manipulate demand with customer programs urging less consumption to make demand more closely match supply, as
      power utilities do. This practice is called <strong>demarketing</strong>.</p>

    <p class="tx">An unusual tale of resource availability unfolded in the summer of 2011. The demand for feathers used
      by fly fishers in tying flies was eclipsed by hairdressers who wanted the plumes to serve clients drawn to a new
      fashion trend&#x2014;long, colorful feathers bonded or clipped into their hair. The two niche markets competed for
      the resource. Because no one anticipated the fashion trend, the supply of suitable feathers fell far short of the
      demand from both niches. The price for a batch of the feathers jumped from about $120 to $1,000. Some suppliers to
      the fly-fishing trade agreed to sell to hairdressers, reaping bonanza prices (Zezima, 2011a).</p>

    <p class="tx">That same summer, supply outstripped demand for farmers&#x2019; produce as new farmers markets opened
      in some areas of the United States. The number of markets surpassed consumers&#x2019; demand. Instead of serving
      new customers, the new markets cannibalized the older markets&#x2019; customer base. Farmers reported having to
      add more markets to their weekly schedule just to match their earnings of a few years past&#x2014;reducing time in
      the field, adding transportation and employee costs, and eating into profits (Zezima, 2011b).</p>

    <p class="tx">Because customer demand is rarely stable, retailers must forecast changes to decide how much inventory
      to keep on hand. Upstream from retailers, the same shift in demand magnifies in an &#x201C;oscillating&#x201D;
      effect as each channel partner forecasts downstream changes in demand and adjusts production accordingly. If
      displayed graphically, the resulting economic effect would resemble a cracking whip, which gave rise to the term
      <strong>bullwhip effect</strong> for this economic pattern. For an illustration of this effect, consider what
      happened to supply chains during the financial crisis of 2008 that led to the Great Recession. That year U.S.
      retail sales declined by 12%. U.S. manufacturers, realizing their current inventory may be high given the low
      demand, reduced inventories by 15%. Manufacturers cut orders to their suppliers, and as a result, manufacturing
      sales declined almost 30%. At each station up the supply chain, the decline in consumer demand triggered a bigger
      decline in orders, because each supplier had to plan its operations based on future expectations, which appeared
      gloomier the further up that chain they looked (Sheffi, 2015).</p>

    <a id="p276"></a>
    <p class="tx">Part of marketers&#x2019; environmental scanning will involve tracking <strong>economic
        indicators</strong>, using trend reports to predict trends like recessions or inflation. Trend reports include
      <strong>leading indicators</strong>, which typically change before the economy changes, and <strong>lagging
        indicators</strong>, which represent trends that are perceivable only after the economy has changed. Marketers
      should follow leading indicators, including the following:</p>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">average initial weekly claims for state unemployment insurance</li>
      <li class="bl">interest rates </li>
      <li class="bl">new building permits issued</li>
      <li class="bl">the consumer confidence index</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Lagging indicators to watch include the following:</p>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">the duration of unemployment</li>
      <li class="bl">the average prime rate trend</li>
      <li class="bl">the consumer price index</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">The weak signals discussed earlier are leading indicators that are so near the forward edge that they
      haven&#x2019;t yet been gathered into economic reports. Lagging indicators, while more readily available, are less
      useful to marketers. Leading indicators are signposts that help us see the road ahead, possibly in time to choose
      a better route. Consider pop-up Halloween stores. Once a year they occupy the abandoned shells of former
      retailers, filling shelves with merchandise that reflects both perennial costume favorites and current
      entertainment hits, like superhero movies. If you were in charge of marketing decisions for one of these stores,
      you would watch the leading indicators of economic health in the months ahead of your Labor Day Grand Opening to
      estimate sales volume, and watch box office sales of movies to help you plan your product mix.</p>

    <p class="tx">One of the major trends over recent decades has been change in income distribution. For households in
      the top fifth of the population, incomes have risen. For the other 80%, incomes have declined, as shown in Figure
      8.1 (Berliner, 2007).</p>

    </div>


    <p class="tx">Retailers expect continued divergence in spending behavior between the squeezed and the prosperous
      consumers. Data from 2013 show the trend continuing: Household income for the top 10% was 12.1 times the level of
      household income for the bottom 10% (Donovan, 2015). A marketer conducting an environmental scan should therefore
      look for signs of change in the economic cycle&#x2014;supply/demand shifts that might limit either supplies needed
      to make a retailer&#x2019;s products or customers to buy them, and changes in consumer spending on disposable and
      discretionary offerings due to the widening gap in purchasing power of the &#x201C;two Americas.&#x201D;</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.4.2">Political/Legal Factors</h2>

    <p class="tx">The <strong>political environment</strong> is made up of the laws and government agencies that limit
      the activities of organizations and individuals, and the advocacy groups that seek to influence those governmental
      agencies. These laws are intended to protect companies, consumers, and society. Certain laws and their
      interpretations require businesses to operate in specific ways that maintain fair competitive practices and
      protect consumers&#x2019; rights, all of which may affect marketing decisions.</p>

    <p class="tx">Protecting consumers is at the heart of many regulations affecting businesses. Consumer protection
      laws seek to limit harm to individuals and the natural environment. Most recently, laws to protect consumers
      online have been passed to deal with online privacy, identity theft, and protecting children. International,
      federal, state, and local laws and regulations are often overlapping and contradictory. Regulations at all levels
      of government change often, so marketers must be diligent in understanding the legal system&#x2019;s relationship
      to marketing decisions and must take responsibility for compliance with all laws affecting their work.</p>

    <p class="tx">Regulations touch on all aspects of the four Ps of marketing strategy, as shown in Table 8.2.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.4.3">Beyond the Force of Law: Advocacy and Industry Groups</h2>

    <p class="tx">Public and private interest groups exist to advance the rights of groups ranging from consumers to
      minorities, senior citizens, animals, and more. The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and American
      Humane Association are two examples. While these groups may not have the force of law behind their calls for
      adherence to specific rules of behavior, companies interested in winning the loyalty of their customers will look
      beyond the regulatory system to seek out ways to honor consumer concerns and protect their interests.</p>

    <p class="tx">Many industries and professions have developed codes of ethics and guidelines for responsible conduct,
      with which members voluntarily comply. Examples include the Council of Better Business Bureaus and the Direct
      Marketing Association.</p>

    <a id="p279"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.4.4">Medical Marijuana Puts Political/Legal Factors in the Spotlight</h2>

    <p class="tx">For an example of the contradiction of regulations at federal and state levels, consider the legal
      confusion around medical marijuana&#x2019;s status in the United States. In 2011 federal agents cracked down on
      growers and sellers in California, in spite of state laws approved in 1996 authorizing what has grown into a
      billion-dollar industry. Federal laws still classified possession and sale of marijuana as a crime, without
      exceptions for medical use. In the fall of 2011, federal prosecutors raided or threatened to seize the property of
      dozens of Californian marijuana growers and dispensaries regarded by local law enforcement as law abiding under
      state and local regulation. The businesses were breaking federal law but were following the laws of the state in
      which they operated. Federal justice officials cited as the reason for their action their skepticism that the
      scale of the Californian medical marijuana market could be driven solely by medical need (Eckholm, 2011). The crux
      of the issue comes down to the federal war on illegal drugs versus states&#x2019; desire to offer medical
      marijuana as an option for health conditions&#x2014;with a dash of economic interest on the side. Proponents
      estimated legalizing marijuana would add a potential $240 million to $360 million in sales taxes to the
      state&#x2019;s budget (Gieringer, 2009).</p>

    <p class="tx">The changing political climate that followed the election of Donald Trump reshuffled the deck in this
      ongoing game of federal vs. state laws. By 2017 one fifth of Americans lived in states that legalized marijuana
      for recreational use, and medicinal marijuana was legal to an estimated 200 million U.S. citizens. In fact,
      consumers spent nearly $6 billion on legal cannabis in 2016. </p>

    <p class="tx">But the industry operated in a gray zone because the U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, viewed
      cannabis as a driver of social problems, like opioid addiction. At the time the marijuana industry was protected
      by a federal budget provision that prohibits Justice Department money from being spent to block state laws
      allowing cannabis, but for how long? Some legislators supported expanded legalization of cannabis and loosening of
      regulations that prevent the industry from functioning like &#x201C;normal&#x201D; businesses. Some supported
      continuing the status quo, and some supported the attorney general&#x2019;s position that the federal government
      should enforce its stricter laws over states&#x2019; more relaxed ones. </p>

    <p class="tx">Consider the value chain that includes the growers, processors, retailers, and consumers&#x2014;not to
      mention the ancillary businesses that sell materials and services to the industry&#x2014;and you find many people
      monitoring political and legal factors in the marketing environment (Chilkoti, 2017). </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.4.5">Marketers Respond to Economic and Political/Legal Factors</h2>

    <p class="tx">To summarize the impacts of economic and political/legal factors on marketing practice: Economic
      conditions affect how much consumers can afford to spend&#x2014;and therefore what they will be purchasing. Their
      gross income must cover their needs for disposable income and any discretionary purchases. The economic cycle
      stage&#x2014;prosperity, recession, or recovery&#x2014;significantly affects income and thus consumer demand.
      Marketers&#x2019; environmental scanning will cover leading and lagging economic indicators to predict changes
      ahead. A significant trend currently affecting consumers in the United States is the increasing disparity in
      income.</p>

    <a id="p280"></a>
    <p class="tx">The political/legal environment requires compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, as
      well as prevailing social codes and industry guidelines for ethical behavior. This is complicated by the fact that
      not only are existing laws confusing and often overlapping in jurisdiction, but the burden of compliance is on the
      business or organization, which must stay current on a frequently changing body of information.</p>

    <p class="tx">You&#x2019;ve now taken a 360-degree tour of the marketing environment. You&#x2019;re aware of the
      actors and forces at work in the micro and macro environment. You recognize the techniques of environmental
      scanning and how to apply them to the marketing environment (sociocultural, ecological, technological, economic,
      and political/legal). But today&#x2019;s marketplace is essentially global, which is why in the next section we
      will discuss how every company&#x2019;s environmental scan must detect threats and opportunities coming from
      beyond the home market&#x2019;s national borders.</p>


    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider </strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Earlier in this chapter you were asked to consider trends affecting a manufacturer of vinyl records.
        How might economic and political/legal trends affect a company that produces LPs? How might those trends differ
        for a company that markets a streaming music service like Pandora or Spotify?</p>
    </div>


    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec8.5">8.5&#x2002;The Global Business Environment</h1>

    <p class="tx">For companies considering doing business in foreign markets, either as buyers or sellers, an
      understanding of the environment in those markets is essential. A scan of the culture, technology, ecology,
      economics, and political/legal factors in the country of interest is a must.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.5.1">Sociocultural Factors Abroad</h2>

    <p class="tx">Consider the U.S. population trends discussed earlier&#x2014;population aging, increasingly diverse
      race/ethnicity, and the demographic shifts toward more variation in household types and gender roles. How might
      those trends play out in other cultures?</p>

    <p class="tx">In 2018 the fastest growing region in the world was East Asia and the Pacific, according to the World
      Bank. China&#x2019;s economy was expected to grow at a pace of 6.4% in 2018, in contrast to the developed
      world&#x2019;s expected rate of 2.2%. Meanwhile, in India, economic growth was expected to reach 7.3% that year
      (Wroughten, 2018).</p>

    <p class="tx">Does that mean marketers can treat China and India as one monolithic growth market? No. The
      sociocultural dynamics of India and China are different and deserve a closer look. Two differences between the two
      countries&#x2019; demographic trends bear on their prospects as consumer markets: population growth and age
      distribution. China will soon hand the baton to India in the competition for largest population. This is due to a
      higher fertility rate in India than China, where the total fertility rate has been below replacement level since
      1991. The two countries&#x2019; age distributions are also undergoing significant change. By 2035 India&#x2019;s
      population will still be largest below 50, while China&#x2019;s population will skew toward older age groups.</p>

    <a id="p281"></a>
    <p class="tx">What do these differences imply for the two countries&#x2019; prospects as consumer markets? As
      populations grow, so does consumer spending. As the percentage of the population of working age grows, so does
      economic stability. When a large share of a country&#x2019;s population is in the workforce, that country sees
      income growth and high per capita savings. China will experience this &#x201C;demographic dividend&#x201D; sooner
      than India will. As each country&#x2019;s population ages, its savings rate will likely reverse, as a larger
      proportion of the population uses savings for retirement. The workforce may see reduced productivity, since both
      cultures have traditionally relied on family members to care for their elders. This may cause adult children to
      spend their time and money caring for their parents instead of contributing to economic growth. China will
      experience this progression of events sooner than India will (Rand Corporation, 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">Other countries in emerging markets will likely follow similar paths, living up to the adage that
      &#x201C;demographics are destiny.&#x201D; If those markets follow a similar path to that of the U.S. population, a
      similar shift toward nations of niches will be seen.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.5.2">Global Technology and Ecology Factors</h2>

    <p class="tx">A critical technology factor affecting global markets is communication infrastructure, which varies
      significantly among countries. For developing countries, access to the Internet holds significant promise. All the
      information resources of the world will become available as soon as the infrastructure to carry it arrives, but
      infrastructure relies on investment, typically from foreign companies.</p>

    <p class="tx">Also important is the existence of infrastructure for transportation (roads, railways, airports) and
      energy production and distribution (gas, electricity, or solar). Countries where communications, transportation,
      and financial transactions can move freely are fertile ground for international commerce.</p>

    <p class="tx">But ecological concerns bring the globalization paradox to the foreground. Globalization can have both
      positive and negative effects on the natural environment; it can exacerbate ecological problems, and it can
      provide solutions to address them. Concerns exist over endangered resources through overharvesting and the
      potential for transboundary pollution of land, water, and air. Governmental regulations have traditionally dealt
      only with territorial sovereignty. That view is not adequate to address global-scale threats to natural
      ecosystems, for which territorial boundaries mean little (Esty &amp; Ivanova, 2003).</p>

    <p class="tx">The World Trade Organization (WTO) deals with the global rules of commerce between nations, primarily
      to ensure that trade flows as smoothly as possible. The WTO is run by member governments. Protection of natural
      environments is a fundamental goal of the WTO, but its focus as a trade organization brings tension between
      economic development and ecological <strong>sustainability</strong>. The challenge, for the WTO and all
      political/legal bodies with international influence, is to establish an appropriate mix of competition,
      cooperation, market forces, and collective action to ensure both economic prosperity and environmental protection
      (Esty &amp; Ivanova, 2003). </p>

    <a id="p282"></a>
    <p class="tx">An example of the interaction between technology and ecology in the global business environment is
      China&#x2019;s leadership in championing electric cars. In 2017 the Chinese government issued rules requiring 1
      out of 5 cars sold in China to be powered by alternative fuels. The country has already become a leader in
      green-energy businesses like wind and solar power. China is also the world&#x2019;s largest manufacturer and
      seller of electric cars. Electric cars are perceived as a particularly good fit for China, where crowded cities
      mean short driving distances, and the existing high-speed rail system reduces demand for vehicles designed for
      long road trips (Bradsher, 2017). </p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.5.3">Foreign Economic and Political/Legal Factors</h2>

    <p class="tx">Another important factor in the global business environment is the level of economic development in
      the country of interest. For comparison, each country&#x2019;s gross national income (GNI) per capita is
      calculated by dividing the value of all goods and services produced in a country by its average population. The
      World Bank groups countries into tiers according to GNI per capita. In 2016 the World Bank divided the groups as
      follows:</p>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">low income: $11,025 or less (e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of&#xA0;Korea)</li>
      <li class="bl">lower middle income: $1,026 and $4,035 (e.g., Iraq, Guatemala, Uzbekistan, Cambodia)</li>
      <li class="bl">upper middle income: $4,036 and $12,475 (e.g., Venezuela, Thailand, Peru)</li>
      <li class="bl">high income: $12,476 or more (Bahrain, Britain, Switzerland, United States) </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">The financial crisis that began in the United States in 2007 spread to other high-income countries,
      then by the end of 2008 to low-income countries as well. By 2010 it had affected economic development around the
      world. While some growth still occurred in the Great Recession&#x2019;s wake, the pace slowed by several
      percentage points. The low- and middle-income countries in North Africa and the Middle East saw the largest drop,
      according to the World Bank (2017).</p>

    <p class="tx">Even countries with a low GNI per capita can be profitable markets, even in a recessionary economic
      climate. India, for example, is classified as a lower-middle-income economy, but because its population is so
      large even small niche segments of that population can be quite large (World Bank, 2011).</p>

      </p>
    </div>

    <a id="p283"></a>
    <p class="tx">Another economic factor worth noting is the direct impact the value of a country&#x2019;s currency and
      the volatility of its exchange rate have on profits. If a foreign currency goes up relative to the U.S. dollar,
      foreign products become more expensive in the United States. If the exchange rate goes down, foreign products
      become cheaper. It&#x2019;s not hard to see how this might lead to difficulty maintaining profits. Consider a
      travel company that sells tours at a specific price based on negotiations with suppliers in the destination
      country. Fluctuations could significantly enhance&#x2014;or erode&#x2014;the profitability of tours sold, simply
      because of the difference between the exchange rate the day the deal was struck and the exchange rate on the day
      the bills come due. After the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (the &#x201C;Brexit&#x201D; vote of
      June 2016), the pound dropped sharply and inflation increased, making imports more expensive. Every aspect of
      Britain&#x2019;s economy has felt the effect (Partington &amp; Clarke, 2017).</p>

    <p class="tx">Political and legal factors constitute perhaps the most difficult aspects of doing business globally.
      The differences in regulatory environments among countries are vast. Companies hoping to penetrate the thicket of
      laws and regulations in effect in a foreign market will likely either hire lawyers from the country of interest to
      provide advice, or partner with local businesspeople experienced in overcoming bureaucratic impediments. Either
      strategy gives firms access to new markets without the expense of maintaining international legal expertise on
      staff.</p>

    <p class="tx">Trade controls such as <em>tariffs</em> (taxes on imports) and <em>quotas</em> (limits on quantities
      of goods that can be imported over a specific period) present a potential political/legal barrier. Tariffs make
      foreign goods more expensive and raise revenues for governments. Quotas typically protect domestic producers
      against imports. Tariffs and quotas can make it difficult for a company to enter a market or maintain a
      competitive advantage there.</p>


    <h2 class="h2" id="sec8.5.4">Marketers&#x2019; Response to Global Environmental Factors</h2>

    <p class="tx">What keeps marketers pursuing global strategies, despite the challenges of the business environment?
      The answer lies in the potential to increase profitability by adding new markets. The large size and dramatic
      growth of the Indian and Chinese markets indicate great potential for consumer goods and services. Brazil, Russia,
      and South Africa are not far behind in economic development, giving rise to the term <em>BRICS countries</em> for
      these five foreign markets. In the early 2000s their tremendous growth potential led to estimates their economies
      would surpass the U.S. and European economies by 2027 (Foroohar, 2009). And yet, the adverse economic conditions
      following the Great Recession took a toll on the BRICS countries, the <em>Guardian</em> reported in 2016, citing
      political troubles in South Africa and Brazil, Russia&#x2019;s recession, and China&#x2019;s economic
      contractions. Only India, with its relatively closed economy, was somewhat unaffected by the slowdown in global
      trade. However, optimism remains for the BRICS countries, due to their combination of size, resources, and
      youthful populations (Tisdall, 2016). </p>

    <p class="tx">In the Marketing 3.0 era, more companies are expected to explore global strategies, leveraging faster
      communications, transportation, and financial transactions into new opportunities for profit. But marketing
      thought leaders recognize that marketing techniques from the United States don&#x2019;t necessarily export well,
      in part because people in emerging markets are just learning to be consumers.</p>

    <a id="p284"></a>
    <p class="tx">As has been shown, business planners must get to know the trends in the marketing environment in any
      country where they hope to do business. A deep understanding of the major U.S. population trends under way will
      help marketers understand shifts taking place in emerging markets.</p>

    <p class="tx">Around the world, we can expect consumer spending to rise as populations of working age increase,
      resulting in income growth and economic stability. However, if communication, transportation, and energy
      infrastructure are lacking, it may be difficult for companies to harvest the potential in those growth markets.
      Additional complications arise from ecological, economic, and political/legal factors.</p>

    <p class="tx">Great opportunity exists for marketers to reach new consumers in foreign markets. But they should
      fully background themselves in all aspects of a foreign market and build alliances with local experts before
      attempting to develop a strategic marketing mix for consumers in other nations.</p>


    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider </strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">The dramatic population growth in China and India is currently dominated by the young. Trends toward
        Western-style consumption are under way in both nations. Given the emphasis on the youth market in the United
        States over the past 60 years, what can you predict for marketers in these newly youth-oriented consumer
        economies as they follow the same path?</p>
      <p class="tx">What products and services will interest these new youth markets?</p>
      <p class="tx">What opportunity for U.S. companies might you foresee?</p>

    <h2 class="Case-Study h2" id="ch08casestudy"><strong>Case Study: </strong><em>Italian Accordion Manufacturers</em>
    </h2>

    <div class="photo-right">
      <img id="img8.7" class="scaled" alt="Man playing accordion." title="Man playing accordion." src="images/8.7.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Mart&#xED;n Damian Monterisi iStock/Getty Images Plus</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">Shifting musical tastes are just one environmental factor affecting demand for accordions
        manufactured in Castelfidardo; a shift in focus from quantity to quality has helped this town&#x2019;s key
        industry survive.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">In the small hill town of Castelfidardo on Italy&#x2019;s Adriatic coast, decades of shifting trends
      in the marketing environment have required accordion manufacturers to adapt. A shift in focus from quantity to
      quality has allowed this town&#x2019;s key industry to survive&#x2014;and even thrive.</p>

    <p class="tx">Accordions were once fixtures of popular music throughout Europe. The accordion&#x2019;s popularity
      spread with emigration. By the 1940s the artisans of Castelfidardo produced tens of thousands of the instruments
      to meet global demand.</p>

    <p class="tx">Today the largest accordion manufacturer in Castelfidardo is the Pigini company, founded at the close
      of World War II by Filippo Pigini with his four sons as partners. Pigini&#x2019;s business acumen drove the firm
      to prominence. Soon the company was shipping its products to the United States, Canada, Sweden, Denmark,
      Argentina, Egypt, and Pakistan (Pigini, 2011). But today the company only builds about 1,500 accordions a year
      (Povoledo, 2011).</p>

    <a id="p285"></a>
    <p class="tx">What happened between the accordion&#x2019;s 1940s heyday and today? How did Pigini manage to
      negotiate trends in the marketing environment to stay in business? Environmental scanning must have played a role.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">In Pigini&#x2019;s micro environment today are customers from around the world who appreciate an
      accordion built to demanding quality standards. Also in the micro environment are the two-dozen-plus accordion
      companies in Castelfidardo that compete with Pigini, and other stakeholders, including the labor force in
      Castelfidardo.</p>

    <p class="tx">What might an environmental scan of the macro environment affecting the Castelfidardo accordion trade
      reveal?</p>

    <p class="tx">Sociocultural factors include eroding musical tastes for the accordion that are shrinking the customer
      base, and a workforce in which young laborers increasingly reject the years of training required for accordion
      building in favor of more modern skills like computer programming. Those who have mastered the traditional skills
      find them in demand for other jobs in mechanical assembly and woodworking. This places pressure on the accordion
      manufacturers to find and retain laborers.</p>

    <p class="tx">It was a technology factor that first caused demand for accordions to wane&#x2014;the introduction of
      the electric guitar. It&#x2019;s no coincidence that the first solid-body guitar was introduced in 1952 and
      production in Castelfidardo peaked in 1953 when nearly 200,000 accordions were made. Demand has never been the
      same since more modern musical instruments emerged. Today competition from computerized music options and even
      video games like <em>Guitar Hero</em> and <em>Rock Band</em> are an increasing factor.</p>

    <p class="tx">No factors involving ecological concerns appear to have had significant impact on the accordion makers
      of Castelfidardo.</p>

    <p class="tx">The primary economic factor affecting the industry has been the rise of manufacturing in China, where
      the focus has been production of basic models, primarily for consumption within that country. Supply and demand
      factors have caused Castelfidardo&#x2019;s artisans to focus on building top-quality instruments, for which a more
      modest level of global demand remains. Many in Castelfidardo see China&#x2019;s production as a benefit to their
      industry, as it keeps interest in accordions alive and growing along with the Chinese population. They reason that
      some of those players will become professionals, who will look for quality instruments in time&#x2014;and become
      customers of companies in Castelfidardo.</p>

    <p class="tx">Until those buyers come looking for instruments, the market for accordions is essentially saturated.
      The only opportunity for competitive advantage lies in innovation; without that edge, there is little reason for
      accordionists to trade up to a new instrument.</p>

    <a id="p286"></a>
    <p class="tx">The political/legal factors facing Pigini and the other companies in Castelfidardo are those facing
      any company doing business globally. With distributors in 31 countries, Pigini must stay current on a wide range
      of international trade regulations.</p>

    <p class="tx">How are the accordion makers of Castelfidardo responding to the ongoing shifts in their marketing
      environment? Pulling together with competitors to develop a coordinated approach to market and technical research
      is one answer. Sharing costs and coordinating efforts could help these companies maintain their competitive
      position while improving profitability.</p>


    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Challenge Question</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Call to mind a product or service you buy regularly. Do opportunities exist in foreign markets for
        sales of that item or service? Which ones?</p>
      <p class="tx">What are the major environmental facts and trends in those countries that might affect sales of that
        product or service?</p>
      <p class="tx">Who at present are the largest consumers of that product or service in the home market, and who
        would be its likely customers abroad?</p>
      <p class="tx">What is the nature of competition in that product category in the foreign market you&#x2019;ve
        identified?</p>
    </div>


    <h2 class="eoc-h2" id="ch08keyideas">Key Ideas to Remember</h2>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">In the micro environment are actors from stakeholder groups closely aligned with a company&#x2019;s
        strategic goals, as well as its competitors, channel partners, customers, and the public. In the macro
        environment are larger societal forces, including culture, technology, ecology, the economy, and political/legal
        dynamics. Environmental scanning is used primarily to understand forces in the macro environment but may also
        bring to light problems in the micro environment.</li>
      <li class="bl">Sociocultural trends affecting consumer society derive from demographic groups and the values and
        beliefs they hold. Dominant demographic trends currently include overall population growth, the increasing
        proportion of people over 65, and the increasing proportion of the population from Hispanic, Asian, Black, and
        multiracial backgrounds. The American household is growing more varied, increasingly placing marketers&#x2019;
        emphasis on behavioral data (what people do) as demographics (what people are) become more complex and varied.
        Marketers will continue to evolve marketing techniques to leverage these trends.</li>
      <li class="bl">A technology trend toward media convergence has marketers responding with a cross-channel approach
        that engages consumers across digital, broadcast, and physical experiences. Concerns about ecological issues are
        experienced differently by different demographic groups; marketers are tailoring their strategies to target
        specific niches&#x2019; concerns.</li>
      <li class="bl">Economic conditions affect consumer purchasing. Marketers track economic indicators to predict how
        those conditions will change. Political/legal conditions require compliance with all applicable laws, as well as
        prevailing social codes and industry guidelines.</li>
      <li class="bl">The growth in emerging economies around the world is creating opportunities for marketers,
        particularly in India and China. While cultural, technological, ecological, economic, and political/legal
        differences create challenges, marketers pursue opportunities in new markets in the hope of reaching many
        profitable new consumers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="eoc-h2" id="ch08criticalthinking">Critical-Thinking Questions</h2>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">Imagine that you want to start a company that will offer cell phone accessories. Describe pressures
        from external factors facing your company and identify whether they should be considered part of the macro
        environment or the micro environment.</li>
      <li class="nl">Name at least three sources of information you will include in your environmental scanning to
        understand forces in the macro environment that influence the cell phone accessories industry niche. Expand on
        how you will locate and monitor useful information sources.</li>
      <li class="nl">The trend toward smaller households created an opportunity for food manufacturers to offer products
        packaged with fewer portions. What other opportunities do small households represent for marketers? One example
        is the 2009 publication of Judith Jones&#x2019;s cookbook titled <em>The Pleasures of Cooking for One</em>. Can
        you think of other examples?</li>
      <li class="nl">Appraise the three trends identified by the Pew Research Center discussed in this chapter:
        increasing racial and ethnic diversity, more diverse family/household types, and an aging population in both the
        United States and abroad. Can you distinguish ways these trends overlap? How does a trend contribute to more
        than one of these population changes?</li>
      <li class="nl">Consider the technology trend toward media convergence and marketers&#x2019;
        &#x201C;omnichannel&#x201D; response. Describe an experience you have had as a consumer that reflects this
        response. Have you noticed marketing messages from one brand in multiple media, combining digital and physical
        experiences?</li>
      <li class="nl">Two areas of recent technological change include increased communications and data management
        capacity. These offer the promise of better customer service, but the promise is not always realized. Describe a
        positive or negative experience you have had as a consumer that reflects a company&#x2019;s use of communication
        and database technology.</li>
      <li class="nl">Are you concerned about the natural environment? Which ecology issues concern you the most? Do you
        think people should be willing to pay more for products or services that promise to be ecologically sustainable
        in terms of their manufacture, distribution, and waste disposal? Why or why not?</li>
      <li class="nl">Describe how a phase of economic recovery affects consumers. Draw on your own personal experiences
        if possible.</li>
      <li class="nl">Several failures by companies to maintain the privacy of their customers&#x2019; personal
        information have been widely reported. Do you think legal action&#x2014;for example, passage of more stringent
        laws regarding storage and use of data&#x2014;can make personal information safer? Suggest other means of
        protecting consumers&#x2019; data besides the force&#xA0;of law.</li>
      <li class="nl">As more businesses operate in global markets, protection of consumers&#x2019; safety crosses
        borders, making regulation more difficult to enact and enforce. How might the consumerism movement adapt?</li>

    <h1 class="h1" id="ch09intro">Introduction</h1>



    <p class="tx">Managing the marketing process is central to the operation of any business in any industry sector.
      Chapter 2 covered the &#x201C;what&#x201D; of that process&#x2014;the steps that take place in a specific order to
      carry out the marketing function for a business. This chapter takes a different approach to the same subject,
      tying together many themes from previous chapters. At this point in your study of the basic principles of
      marketing, you know a great deal more about the marketing mix, customer markets, competitors, and environmental
      influences than when you began. You are ready to deepen your understanding of the concerns of marketing
      management&#x2014;the &#x201C;who,&#x201D; the &#x201C;how,&#x201D; and the &#x201C;why&#x201D; behind the
      marketing process.</p>

    <p class="tx">Managing the marketing effort requires four functions:</p>

    <ol class="nl">

      <li class="nl">analysis</li>
      <li class="nl">planning</li>
      <li class="nl">implementation</li>
      <li class="nl">control</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">In this chapter, we will consider each in turn&#x2014;but first, let&#x2019;s confirm that they are
      taking place within the frame of integrated marketing communications (IMC)&#x2014;the management approach required
      to achieve coordination across those four functions in today&#x2019;s multichannel message environment, online and
      offline. IMC demands that organizations link all management initiatives related to brand communications so that
      receivers encounter a consistent message across all channels. The increasing complexity of marketing
      communications across paid, owned, earned, and shared (POES) message channels (discussed in Chapter 6) gives
      urgency to the adoption of the IMC approach, in order to manage the marketing effort more effectively.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec9.1">9.1&#x2002;Integrated Marketing Communications</h1>

    <p class="tx">Successful use of the IMC approach requires teamwork across every business function touched by sales,
      marketing, and corporate communications. In-house resources must work seamlessly with outside partners, like
      traditional advertising agencies, digital marketing firms, media buyers, and more. But achieving a meaningful
      level of coordination among internal units, service providers, channel partners, and customers is not easy. </p>

    <p class="tx">The fundamental concern of IMC is <em>integration</em>. What does it take to ensure that audiences
      encounter a consistent and effective message across all channels? That consistency is what turns disparate
      messages into positive associations linked to a brand in the minds and memories of the target audience. Thus, the
      goal of IMC must be to make certain that all of a brand&#x2019;s communications work together to support each
      other and provide a unified message to the target audience (Hatheway, 2013). </p>

    <p class="tx">As digital platforms have proliferated, so have the number of ways in which a brand can communicate
      with its target market&#x2014;and more to the point, the number of ways in which a consumer can assemble an
      impression of the brand.</p>

    <a id="p293"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.1.1">A Quick History of IMC</h2>
    <p class="tx">The first definition of IMC appeared in 1989, written by a task force of the American Association of
      Advertising Agencies attempting to make coordinated marketing the domain of the advertising agency (as opposed to
      the client firm). This was during the marketing era discussed in Chapter 1, in which increasing professional
      specialization in the marketing discipline was making coordination more difficult to achieve. </p>

    <p class="tx">As the marketing era gave way to the relationship era in the 1990s and the marketer&#x2019;s objective
      became developing long-term relationships with customers, IMC gained credibility. Academics and practitioners
      alike were drawn to IMC for its promise of sustainable competitive advantage that the marketing department could
      control (M&#x16B;noz-Leiva, Porcu, &amp; del Barrio-Garc&#xED;a, 2014). Its principles were codified and taught by
      Professor Don Schultz at the Northwestern University Medill School of Journalism. Long considered the
      &#x201C;father of IMC,&#x201D; Schultz is the author of over a dozen books on the subject and is still active in
      promoting the IMC approach (Northwestern University, 2016).</p>

    <p class="tx">Over the decades, the question of where responsibility for controlling IMC should rest remained in
      flux. The advertising industry went through significant changes in the 1980s and 1990s, when large firms bought up
      smaller specialist shops, in part to create capability to handle the increasing proliferation of promotional
      channels. Consolidation allowed agencies to achieve integrated strategy and execution across those channels by
      keeping control under one roof. But clients weren&#x2019;t necessarily eager to be bound so tightly to one agency.
      As the 1990s gave way to the 2000s, client organizations began to move the brand management role in-house, taking
      control of IMC (J. Karrh, personal communication, January 14, 2016).</p>

    <p class="tx">More recently, as the humanity-centric Marketing 3.0 era has begun to drive marketing thought and
      practice with its view of customers as collaborative partners, acceptance of the importance of IMC has been
      increasing because IMC is inherently customer-centric (London School of Marketing, 2015). The current definition
      of IMC from the <em>Journal of Integrated Marketing Communications</em> (2017) provides the foundation for
      understanding how IMC is currently practiced: </p>

    <p class="ext">Integrated marketing communications (IMC) is a strategic approach through which organizations drive
      performance by engaging, serving and communicating with consumers and other stakeholders. </p>

    <p class="ext">IMC combines qualitative understanding of consumers with large-scale analytics to develop
      communications and content that build and maintain strong brands. Grounded in advertising, IMC has emerged as the
      premier way for organizations to manage customer experiences in the digital age. (p. 4) </p>

    <p class="tx">Adopting the IMC approach means committing to grounding all components of marketing communications in
      research and coordinating efforts so the target audience receives a single consistent message. How companies
      approach IMC has changed over the decades, but one reality has become clear: The need for strategic coordination
      of marketing efforts to deliver consistent customer experiences is here to stay.</p>

    <a id="p294"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.1.2">The IMC Imperative</h2>
    <p class="tx">The media landscape is constantly expanding, with new digital media channels being introduced and new
      uses for traditional media being discovered every day. IMC has become an imperative, for three reasons:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">As audiences have become more fragmented, the audience reached by any single media channel gets
        smaller and smaller. Advertisers must use multiple channels to reach everyone in a target market. </li>
      <li class="nl">Consumers integrate the message themselves. The brand narrative they perceive emerges from the sum
        of all points of contact that the consumer has with the company. Encountering the same message via every channel
        from television to social media to in-person experiences increases the integrity and consistency of that
        perception. </li>
      <li class="nl">For cost efficiency, companies must coordinate their efforts across multiple departments and
        platforms. By reducing duplication of effort and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing
        communications, IMC maximizes return on a company&#x2019;s investment in marketing.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">The strategic management implied by IMC will remain necessary, if challenging, even as the options for
      delivering the message proliferate and change (Percy, 2008).</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.1.3">The Push-and-Pull Communication Model</h2>
    <p class="tx">The second point above names a fundamental insight of IMC: the integration referred to occurs as much
      at the external receivers&#x2019; end as it does among the various internal departments and external suppliers
      charged with integrating their contributions to the organization&#x2019;s marketing communications.</p>

    <p class="tx">Schultz has presented widely on what he has termed the <strong>push-and-pull communication
        model</strong> in today&#x2019;s marketplace. In his view, brand communications have traditionally been based on
      outbound, marketer-controlled systems. Consumers now function in a media environment in which they can block
      marketers&#x2019; push messages and assemble their own information network, pulling toward themselves whatever
      they deem relevant and trustworthy. They draw from social media as well as traditional message channels. For this
      reason, marketers must do everything they can to ensure the consistency of messages across all channels, so that
      the message consumers pull together for themselves is consistent with the message that the marketers have pushed.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">In this new paradigm, consumers are as important as marketers in the communication process. IMC should
      be recognized as a means of holistically managing the consumer experience so that the sum of receivers&#x2019;
      participation with brand communications (whether pulled or pushed) is greater than its parts&#x2014;and consistent
      across all channels and experiences.</p>

      <p class="tx">If you&#x2019;d like to hear more from Don Schultz, follow this link to a short video in which he
        discusses his 2016 research paper, &#x201C;The Future of Advertising (or Whatever We&#x2019;re Going to Call
        It),&#x201D; published in the <em>Journal of Advertising</em>.</p>
      <p class="tx"><a class="link" target="_blank"

    </div>


    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec9.2">9.2&#x2002;Marketing Management and the IMC Approach</h1>

    <p class="tx">Schultz expressed concern that marketing practitioners are more likely to have been trained in push
      techniques, rendering them ill equipped to serve consumers who are pulling instead of accepting what is pushed at
      them. Marketers who understand today&#x2019;s pull paradigm must bring their less-forward-thinking peers along,
      even if that means new hires &#x201C;teaching old dogs new tricks.&#x201D;</p>

    <p class="tx">Of course, not every marketing department in every company has the influence to shift senior leaders
      toward adoption of IMC. The power of the marketing department varies from industry to industry and company to
      company.</p>

    <p class="tx">While results may vary depending on the marketing department&#x2019;s ability to lead implementation
      of IMC, certain best practice rules have emerged.</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Get senior management support for the initiative by emphasizing benefits, such as
        cost-effectiveness and shortened sales cycles.</li>
      <li class="bl">Pursue integration both horizontally (across departments) and vertically (among channel partners).
      </li>
      <li class="bl">Create and monitor visual design standards for the use of brand identity elements such as logos and
        typefaces.</li>
      <li class="bl">Develop a robust CRM system to house and share vital information.</li>
      <li class="bl">Articulate a clear marketing communications strategy, from the value proposition on through each
        element of segmentation, targeting, and positioning.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">The firms that adopt IMC will find an additional point of advantage over their late-adopting
      competitors.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.2.1">Concerns Regarding IMC</h2>
    <p class="tx">In a 2015 interview in <em>Forbes</em>, Schultz shared his views on &#x201C;what&#x2019;s wrong with
      marketing today.&#x201D; He took issue with marketers&#x2019; focus on &#x201C;snapshots&#x201D;&#x2014;what
      happened last month or last quarter. He recommended looking at longitudinal data collected over 6 to 10 years to
      reveal meaningful patterns. He also voiced concerns regarding organizations&#x2019; lack of follow-through in
      using the data they collect, especially B2B organizations. It is not surprising that as the father of IMC, Schultz
      is concerned that even decades after the introduction of the IMC approach, marketing practitioners are unprepared
      for the sophisticated demands of today&#x2019;s marketing management. He finds that the biggest challenge facing
      organizations today is the need to retrain managers (Ellett, 2015). </p>

    <p class="tx">Most marketers accept that IMC is strategically important and believe that it should be practiced.
      However, the departments responsible for different channels may not work as collaboratively as IMC demands.
      Adoption of IMC requires considerable restructuring by organizations, ad agencies, and others, but leaders too
      often lack the vision or will to support it directly. Professionals from specialist areas and disciplines have to
      give up their traditional autonomy, budgets, and work processes. A fairly steep learning curve and effort are
      required, for which there may be little motivation (Mishra &amp; Muralie, 2010). Corporate culture and
      organizational structure must adapt to a more collaborative style of work.</p>

    <p class="tx">The problem of accurate measurement dogs practitioners of IMC. One reason for the rapid adoption of
      digital advertising is the ability to measure its performance and thus optimize return on investment.
      Click-through rates and cookies, for example, yield precise data about consumer behavior. Traditional advertising
      has not progressed much beyond the estimates of audience size produced by research firms like Nielsen and
      Arbitron. Thus, IMC creates a mixed bag in which some channels produce quantifiable evidence of cause and effect
      but others do not (J. Karrh, personal communication, January 14, 2016). No means have surfaced to comprehensively
      and accurately measure IMC&#x2019;s effectiveness. This makes it hard to apportion budgets for the different
      campaign elements&#x2014;some investments will always be a &#x201C;surer bet&#x201D; than others.</p>

    <p class="tx">Even though IMC is essential to reach a fragmented audience of potential buyers, achieve consistency
      with consumers who pull messages from different channels at different times, and make marketing spending more
      efficient, it remains difficult to achieve. </p>

    <p class="tx">In conclusion, the fundamental mission of IMC is to effectively manage consumers&#x2019;
      self-constructed impressions of brands (pulled) as well as their encounters with marketers&#x2019; pushed
      communications. IMC creates synergy among all the interrelated elements of the marketing plan. Organizations that
      build on a market orientation adopt IMC to deliver a more holistic consumer experience and thus gain an important
      competitive advantage. But until practitioners accept the challenge of staying current in the field as measurement
      techniques become more sophisticated and demand for multichannel accountability increases, there is cause for
      concern.</p>

    <a id="p297"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.2.2">IMC Success in Action</h2>
    <p class="tx">Have you been on the receiving end of an IMC campaign? The answer is surely yes, because everyone
      today is exposed to so much marketing. </p>

    <p class="tx">Have you ever noticed advertising or branded content from Coca-Cola? The company has been a pioneer in
      IMC. With a core value proposition around a lifestyle of fun and happiness, Coca-Cola has adapted its strategy to
      reach diverse target audiences around the globe. In the early 2000s, using the theme Open Happiness, Coca-Cola
      integrated marketing messages across advertising, direct marketing, sales promotions with channel partners,
      digital marketing, and social media. No matter whether you were in a theater watching a movie, ordering in a
      restaurant, watching television, or surfing the web, anywhere in the world, you were likely to encounter
      consistent Coca-Cola messaging (Coca-Cola, 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">As social media gained favor with young people, Coke strategists determined that the brand should
      build a viral digital marketing campaign around happiness to reach these young consumers. To generate buzz,
      Coca-Cola used experiential marketing that created online engagement as well as real-world excitement. In one of
      several initiatives designed to garner shares in social media, the company installed so-called Happiness Machines
      (or in some countries, Happiness Trucks) that dispensed product in quantity so that a person purchasing one Coke
      suddenly was able to hand out free drinks to everyone around. Hidden cameras were installed to capture videos of
      the Happiness Machines in action, which Coca-Cola subsequently released in social media channels. Almost
      immediately, the videos achieved Coke&#x2019;s goal of going global. Coke released one single video of a Happiness
      Machine installed in a cafeteria at a university in New York to YouTube in January 2010 and announced it with a
      single Facebook status update. Approximately 10 days later, the video had been seen a million times. Within 2
      months, the video had been viewed over 2 million times (Misra, 2015).</p>

    <p class="tx">In 2017 the Coca-Cola-owned brand Fanta earned recognition in Australia for its IMC campaign to
      relaunch the fruit-flavored sparkling beverage, winning a gold medal in the Media Federation of Australia&#x2019;s
      annual award category Best Integrated Campaign. Star of the campaign was a Jelly Fizz flavor variant that took on
      a unique thick consistency after the can was shaken. With a goal of expansion beyond its core tween market, the
      Fanta Relaunch campaign invited teenagers into cocreation at the website Fanta.au. Site visitors over age 13 could
      design their own billboard, customize product flavors, create a Snapchat lens, and upload a soundmix. The 12-week
      campaign drew almost 300,000 teen visits to the website&#x2014;making it the most visited in Coca-Cola&#x2019;s
      history. Teens made 11,841 creations on the site, with 75 selected to receive skateboards, yoga mats, and
      surfboards they had designed&#x2014;turning them into brand ambassadors as they shared their Fanta cocreation
      stories on their social channels. The Snapchat lens reached 65% of Australian users. The Jelly Fizz beverage sold
      at 4 times the rate of regular Fanta Orange, the best sales in 3 years. Teen consumption of Fanta overall rose 4
      points, reversing a declining growth rate. The Media Federation of Australia (2017) contest judges awarded the
      Fanta Relaunch campaign its gold prize for the campaign&#x2019;s strategy of authenticity, creativity, audience
      engagement, and evidence of success in the marketplace. </p>

    <p class="tx">While Coca-Cola&#x2019;s Happiness Machines show an example of a far-reaching, global IMC campaign
      that played out over several years, Fanta Relaunch is an example of a smaller, country- and niche-specific
      campaign that still required the IMC approach to succeed.</p>

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec9.3">9.3&#x2002;Four Functions of Marketing Management: Analysis</h1>

    <p class="tx">It should now be clear that managing the marketing effort takes place within a context of IMC.
      It&#x2019;s time for a closer look at the four functions that comprise marketing management&#x2014;analysis,
      planning, implementation, and control&#x2014;introduced at the start of this chapter.</p>

    <p class="tx">You should already be aware of the analysis function, based on the discussion in Chapter 2 of analysis
      as the first of the steps in the marketing process. Analysis is also where marketing management begins, because
      analysis grounds planning in the realities of what is going on in the macro environment, the industry, the
      company, and most importantly, the lives of customers. Analytic techniques for selecting a strategy were
      introduced in Chapter 2, including the BCG Matrix, Ansoff&#x2019;s Matrix, and SWOT analysis. Now let&#x2019;s
      dive deeper into the input required for analysis: data! Sound, reliable, complete data!</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.3.1">Data Fuels Analysis</h2>

    <p class="tx">With exponential growth in computing power and increasing access to sophisticated data-mining
      techniques, marketers now have more information available than in the past. Plus, visualization of data has made
      that information easier for nontechnical people to comprehend. Marketing management has benefited from these
      advances.</p>

    <p class="tx">Let&#x2019;s start with vocabulary: How do <em>analysis</em> and <em>analytics</em> differ?
      <strong>Analysis</strong> is the examination of data to uncover and understand cause&#x2013;effect relationships
      as a basis for decision making (&#x201C;Analysis,&#x201D; 2018). Analytics, on the other hand, goes deeper.
      <strong>Analytics</strong> describes statistical and mathematical data analysis that examines trends, effects of
      decisions, and quality of tools used to make decisions (&#x201C;Analytics,&#x201D; 2018). Thus, analytics provides
      the inputs to analysis that can guide decisions about strategy. </p>

    <a id="p299"></a>
    <p class="tx">Without data, there could be no analytics; thus, a place to collect the data is required. Multiple
      databases (CRM, website clickstreams, sales transactions, etc.) are usually brought together in a company&#x2019;s
      <strong>data mart</strong> (another term for data warehouse). </p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.3.2">Big Data and Innovation</h2>
    <p class="tx">Companies are folding analytics back into the customer experience and core value proposition of their
      products. For example, the Nike+ personal fitness products incorporate sensor technologies embedded in running
      shoes and wearable devices that connect via the Internet with mobile apps and social networks. Users can track
      their individual performance&#x2014;and they can link their data to that generated by communities of friends and
      even their coaches (de Swaan Arons, Van den Driest, &amp; Weed, 2014). Since its launch in 2006, the Nike+ product
      suite has acquired a user base of 7 million runners. Just as important as the customer experience, which
      transforms running from a solo experience to a data-driven social sport, is the benefit for Nike. The company
      aggregates the millions of data points reported from its customers&#x2019; devices, in real time&#x2014;data that
      is generating insights for future product innovation (Van Rijmenam, 2013).</p>

      <p class="photo-caption">Nike uses Big Data when undertaking its marketing.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">The Nike+ platform exemplifies the use of <strong>Big Data</strong>&#x2014;a phrase that has
      proliferated as rapidly as the computing power that enables it. Big Data has become one of the most-talked-about
      trends, as if it were an imperative for every organization that wants to achieve or maintain a competitive
      advantage. In fact, Big Data is only relevant in situations in which companies must deal with rapid proliferation
      of data, a need to exploit data in real time, new data types (such as sensor data), and/or complex data types
      (such as video) that are not easily indexed by traditional &#x201C;small data&#x201D; approaches (Sowmyanarayanan,
      2015). That being said, some of the more exciting examples of using analytics for product innovation are driven by
      the availability of Big Data. Follow the link in <em>Field Trip 9.4</em> to learn more.</p>

    <p class="tx">As has been shown, analytics can be deployed to aid strategy formulation or innovation. Product
      innovation is especially well served by a Big Data analytics approach. Gather as much as possible of the best data
      available, slice and dice it using sophisticated analytics and visualization software to deeply understand what
      the data is saying, then form hypotheses about possible courses of action. That is the analysis function of
      marketing management.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.3.3">Choosing a Course of Action</h2>
    <p class="tx">Fundamentally, the function of analysis is to identify potential strategies that can create
      competitive advantage by enhancing the customer experience. Some companies choose a strategy of deepening customer
      engagement, for example, by leveraging customer data to personalize marketing of the offering itself. Others
      choose a strategy of broadening engagement by adding touchpoints, each of which becomes an opportunity to collect
      more data (de Swaan Arons et al., 2014). Analysis is a process of matching internal strengths to market
      opportunities. For example, using a SWOT analysis can bring to light a company&#x2019;s greatest opportunities
      while increasing its understanding of the firm&#x2019;s core competencies. </p>

    <p class="tx">The point of analysis is to uncover significant factors affecting a business&#x2019;s likelihood of
      achieving profitable, sustainable growth. Analysis brings about a kind of &#x201C;matchmaking&#x201D; between a
      company&#x2019;s core competencies and the areas where the potential to capitalize on opportunities is greatest.
      Sometimes analysis will result in a clear sense of direction, and choosing a course of action can immediately
      follow. If not, marketing managers may want to dive deeper into their data, looking for insights to guide strategy
      formulation or even innovation that changes the value proposition of their products and services. Marketing
      managers narrow down possible courses of action to decide on specific strategies.</p>

    <p class="tx">Understanding customers is one of the chief applications of analytics, which can lead to choosing a
      course of action. In Chapter 7 the case study on RC Willey showed how analytics were applied to develop a highly
      targeted trigger marketing program based on 7 years of point-of-sale data. This is an example of data-driven
      strategy formulation, with identifying and sending messages to specific customer segments as its objective. It is
      also an example of predictive analytics, because it takes advantage of current and historical data to make
      predictions about future events (consumer purchases).</p>

    <p class="tx">Another example of using analytics to choose a specific course of action comes from DSK Solutions, a
      business analytics consulting practice serving the association and nonprofit industry. An association client
      wanted to better predict expected attendance at its annual conference in order to estimate registration costs,
      venue requirements, and on-site staffing needs. DSK Solutions&#x2019; first task in this engagement was to create
      a data mart from the association&#x2019;s disparate sources containing customer information, past event
      attendance, and membership history, as well as demographics and engagement factors. The consulting firm used
      visualization tools that allowed its client to &#x201C;see&#x201D; its membership&#x2019;s behavior. The analysis
      showed that travel distances of over 500 miles presented a barrier for 85% of potential attendees. Based on that
      insight, the association decided to experiment with holding two annual conferences each year, to minimize
      members&#x2019; travel expense by allowing them to choose the closer location. Not only was the original research
      objective achieved, but the association now has a data mart and visualization tool, as well as a staff trained to
      use it to address further strategic decisions (King, 2015).</p>

    <a id="p301"></a>
    <p class="tx">As these examples show, analysis can aid decision making about marketing programs and product/service
      offerings. Organizations may employ teams of analysts simply to support this function of marketing management, or
      they may contract with outside firms to support their data analytics needs.</p>

      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider </strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Aptitude for analytical thinking is becoming a necessity for employment in marketing management.
        Could reliance on data take the creativity out of choosing a course of action? Explain your thinking.</p>

    <h1 class="h1" id="sec9.4">9.4&#x2002;Functions of Marketing Management: Planning</h1>

    <p class="tx">The second of the four functions required for managing the marketing effort is
      <strong>planning</strong>. The inputs to this function flow from the organization&#x2019;s analysis of its current
      situation. As the marketing planning function takes place, profitability goals are translated into marketing
      objectives and ideas for marketing actions. The outcome of the planning function is usually a written marketing
      plan on which implementation and control can be based. Even without a written plan, the fundamental reason for
      planning is to guide specific, purposeful action.</p>

      <p class="credit">Associated Press</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">Flash mobs&#x2014;like this one that was featured in a McDonald&#x2019;s
        commercial&#x2014;are an example of less traditional marketing techniques. Can you think of any other examples?
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">All organizations require a well-defined <strong>scope</strong> to contain their actions. Each
      company&#x2019;s core vision, mission, and values provide the boundaries within which it will operate and suggest
      the direction in which it will grow. With scope defined, planners must formulate how the company will proceed by
      setting <strong>objectives</strong>, broken into smaller goals supported by tactical action plans. Planners must
      also define how resources such as time, money, and human talent will be allocated. The strategic plan will include
      sections outlining each department&#x2019;s actions and resource allocations, including the marketing department.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">The marketing component of the strategic plan describes every action planned in every message channel,
      from traditional advertising to a flash mob &#x201C;happening&#x201D; at an airport staged to impress customers
      arriving for a trade show. The strategic marketing plan specifies what will take place and all associated costs.
      In short, planning in the context of marketing is all about specifying who will do what, by when, monitored and
      controlled by what measures, backed up by a sound rationale (the &#x201C;why&#x201D; behind all that activity).
    </p>

    <p class="tx">The term <em>strategic planning</em> is often misunderstood and misused. No specific definition is
      widely agreed on. However, most marketing practitioners do agree that to be worthwhile, strategic planning in the
      context of marketing must involve deciding how an organization will deliver customer value, earn profits, and
      secure competitive advantage. </p>

    <a id="p302"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.4.1">Developing the Media Plan</h2>
    <p class="tx">One significant subset of the planning function is the <strong>media plan</strong>, which fills in the
      details of all communication tactics called for by the promotions component of the marketing mix. The media plan
      addresses the schedule on which each message will be deployed, in what channel, and at what cost. Refer to Chapter
      2 for a discussion of message channels, shown in Table 2.5.</p>

    <p class="tx">Media planning is a specialized function within a company&#x2019;s ad agency or marketing department.
      Media planners determine how to reach the right audience at the right time with the right message, working within
      a specific budget. This entails finding the right media channels to use&#x2014;and in what proportion. It can be a
      challenging role, involving expertise in multiple areas&#x2014;the math skills to analyze cost and audience
      numbers, the people skills to negotiating prices, and the good judgment to ascertain which channel will serve best
      for a campaign&#x2019;s creative concept. </p>

    <p class="tx">Advertising agencies have been biased in the past toward basing the media plan on mass market
      advertising, in part because agencies were compensated on a commission system based on the dollar volume of mass
      market billings. Today more agencies are replacing the commission system with a fee-based arrangement with
      clients. The result? More objective evaluation of all media channels and scheduling based on effectiveness of
      specific channels for specific communication objectives (Hackley, 2010).</p>

    <p class="tx">A media plan begins with a goal statement that explains the desired communication outcome. A media
      goal should be stated in precise, measurable terms, such as: <em>Advertising in video game magazines will create a
        20% increase in awareness of Rude Energy Drink in young men ages 18&#x2013;25, who will retain the impression
        that Rude is a delicious way to enhance energy and focus.</em> A goal statement aids media planners in decision
      making and facilitates measuring the return on advertising investment after the plan is executed.</p>

    <p class="tx">Decision factors in media planning include the following:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">determination of reach, frequency, and impact goals</li>
      <li class="nl">choice of message channel</li>
      <li class="nl">selection of specific media vehicles</li>
      <li class="nl">decision regarding timing</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">Media planners balance the need for reach, frequency, and impact to achieve the desired communication
      result within the budget available.</p>

    <a id="p303"></a>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><strong>Reach</strong> estimates how many different people will see or hear a message; reach is
        expressed as a percentage of total people in the target market.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Frequency</strong> estimates how many times each one of those reached will see or hear the
        message; frequency is expressed numerically.</li>
      <li class="bl"><strong>Impact</strong> assesses the message&#x2019;s ability to influence those it reaches; impact
        is qualitative and cannot be expressed in mathematical terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Reach, frequency, and impact come at a cost. The more of each an advertiser hopes to achieve, the
      higher the media spending required. Media planners look for channels that reach the target consumer efficiently
      (without wasted spending) and effectively (in ways that demonstrate the value proposition).</p>

    <p class="tx">A media plan can only achieve its goals if it results in effective communication, meaning there is a
      match between the message and the message channel chosen to deliver it. Communication can take place through rich
      or lean mediums. The richest form is face-to-face communication, because it allows interpretation of vocal tones,
      facial expressions, and other verbal and nonverbal cues. At the lean end of the continuum are e-mails and text
      messages, which convey very little context. Consider a high-end fashion brand: A pop-up fashion show could deliver
      the richest experience. A YouTube video could approximate the excitement of the runway event and demonstrate the
      garments&#x2019; style in action but with less richness. A color magazine ad would be leaner communication but
      still more effective than a black-and-white newspaper ad. A text message would be the least effective way to
      promote high-end fashion, but it could be effectively used for customer communications after a relationship had
      been established. (&#x201C;Hi Joan, the Fendi bag you ordered is in, please stop by to pick it up.&#x201D;)</p>

    <p class="tx">Table 9.1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of some of the major message channels. All the
      online advertising media (websites, ads placed on other websites, search advertising, social media, and mobile)
      share certain advantages: Response can be monitored in real time, and changing online advertising messages is much
      easier than altering messages in traditional media. Overall, online advertising is generally less expensive than
      traditional advertising.</p>

    <p class="tx">Advertisers must reevaluate message channel decisions frequently because audience habits and the types
      of message channels available to advertisers change rapidly. The shift toward target marketing and micromarketing
      strategies, as well as the rapid growth of online advertising channels, is changing the nature of many
      organizations&#x2019; media plans.</p>

      <h1 class="h1"><strong>Field Trip 9.5: </strong><em>Pros and Cons of Online Advertising</em></h1>
      <p class="tx">In 2017 global spending on online advertising reached $209 billion, surpassing television (Kafka
        &amp; Molla, 2017). As this spending increases, it becomes more important for marketers to understand the pros
        and cons of different forms of online advertising.</p>
      <p class="tx">Follow this link to read an article on the pros and cons of online advertising.</p>
      <p class="tx">Display Ads, Search Ads, and Social Media Ads: Pros and Cons</p>
      <p class="tx"><a class="link" target="_blank"

      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Once a general decision has been made about reach, frequency, impact, and the types of message
      channels to use, specific <strong>media vehicles</strong> (specific publications or platforms, such as <em>Sports
        Illustrated</em> or ESPN, as opposed to categories like magazines or TV channels) must be chosen. Media planners
      evaluate vehicles based on <strong>cost per thousand (CPM)</strong> people reached, and qualitative evaluation of
      the degree of attention paid by the audience reached. Comparing CPM calculations for similar blocks of advertising
      yields a quantitative comparison between specific media vehicles, but comparing qualitative aspects such as
      production value and attention quality can be just as important to the decision process.</p>

    <p class="tx">Finally, media planners must decide on timing of their advertising, finding the right balance among
      reach, frequency, and impact. Timing will depend on the goal of the advertising&#x2014;is a new product being
      introduced? Do sales follow a predictable pattern or seasonality? Each situation suggests an appropriate timing
      strategy.</p>

    <p class="tx">Advertising fills message channels in <strong>flights</strong> over given time periods. How the
      flights are arranged can extend an advertising budget. Some scheduling options include the following:</p>

    <ul class="bl">

      <li class="bl"><em>Continuous: </em>A regular pattern over a given period.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Seasonal: </em>A push during natural peaks in demand, or a push during valleys to raise sales
        during lean periods.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Pulse: </em>An on-again, off-again sequence during a given period.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Front loaded:</em> Starting with a push that tapers to a continuous or pulse pattern.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Evaluating media options will always be somewhat like comparing apples and oranges, because each
      message challenge has its own strengths and weaknesses, and each specific vehicle within a media category has its
      own characteristics, from the vocal style of a radio station&#x2019;s announcers to the ratio of ads to content on
      an online platform. Media planners begin with quantitative ranking, using data like CPM for publications, traffic
      counts for billboards, cost per piece for direct mail, and so on to compare options within a media category. Then
      the options that rise to the top through quantitative ranking will be considered from a qualitative
      perspective&#x2014;does a particular media vehicle have characteristics that enhance its advertisers&#x2019;
      messages? Are competitors advertising in this channel? Does the medium support the creative direction of the
      campaign? From these two exercises comes a short list of viable options. Then the decision comes down to balancing
      reach, frequency, and timing against the budget.</p>

    <a id="p306"></a>
    <p class="tx">To arrive at a media budget, planners deduct a portion to cover production costs appropriate to each
      message channel, such as TV commercials, radio, and mobile. Then they decide how to divide the remaining budget to
      purchase airtime or space in each channel, calculating reach, frequency, and timing to arrive at costs (Paulson,
      2011). Media planning decisions command high budgets, with little room for error.</p>

    <p class="tx">A media plan must be developed in sufficient detail to estimate costs. Decision factors in media
      planning include goals for reach, frequency, and impact, plus specifics of message channel usage, media vehicle
      selection, and timing. To make these decisions, planners consider the target consumer, how the offering&#x2019;s
      value proposition might be pitched, and which media vehicles are most likely to reach the target consumer
      efficiently and effectively. The media plan will specify how many ads will run over a given time period. All these
      factors affect the cost of the media plan, which must be calculated before planners can tell whether it fits
      within the overall promotional budget.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.4.2">Setting the Marketing Budget</h2>
    <p class="tx">Once a media plan has been developed, costs can be estimated for the components of that program. Those
      costs must fit into the larger structure of the company&#x2019;s promotional mix, as described in Chapter 6.</p>

    <p class="tx">Planners choose a budget allocation method from several available methodologies, including the
      following:</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><em>Percentage of sales: </em>Allocating a fixed percentage (of past or anticipated sales revenue)
        to advertising.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Task objective:</em> Basing the budget on results to be achieved, tactics required to achieve
        those results, and costs associated with those tactics.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Competitive parity:</em> Estimating and matching competitors&#x2019; spending, which assumes
        other firms have similar marketing objectives and expertise.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Market share: </em>Similar to competitive parity, basing estimated spending on external market
        trends.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Adaptive control:</em> Employing market research to estimate sales volume and profitability
        levels and adjusting the budget accordingly.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>All available funds:</em> Allocating all available profits to marketing; risky and aggressive,
        but useful in certain situations, such as with a start-up business.</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Affordability:</em> Basing the budget on what senior leaders believe the firm can afford to
        spend on marketing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">These methods can be combined to create a more customized approach. Each has its advantages and
      disadvantages. The task-objective approach is generally considered to be the strongest from a strategic point of
      view, since it forces planners to specify assumptions about each tactic and anticipated result, against which
      performance can be measured. However, it is also the most difficult approach to implement. For a closer look at
      these budgeting methods, follow the link in <em>Field Trip 9.6</em>.</p>

    <p class="tx">Regardless of the method of budgeting chosen, planners must decide how to allocate their budget
      dollars across the various communication tactics called for by their marketing strategies (such as
      &#x201C;advertise in <em>Sports Illustrated</em>&#x201D; or &#x201C;deploy brand ambassadors at public
      events&#x201D;). Besides mass-media advertising, the plan might require use of any of the paid or owned message
      channels described in Chapter 6 and listed in Table 6.2.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.4.3">Writing the Marketing Plan</h2>
    <p class="tx">The marketing plan describes actions designed to accomplish the objectives from the company&#x2019;s
      strategic plan. In well-managed firms, the marketing department produces a written marketing plan that describes a
      chosen marketing strategy and how it will be carried out. In less orderly environments, the plan may never be set
      down on paper. Whether a marketing plan follows a formal structure and takes the form of a written document or
      not, it generally exists and governs the activities and priorities of marketers.</p>

    <p class="tx">A marketing plan helps marketers stay on track. With a written plan, it&#x2019;s easier to be
      proactive rather than reactive and to improve with each repetition of the cycle of campaign development and
      execution.</p>

    <p class="tx">The specific format of the plan, and what is included, depends on the nature of the organization, its
      target audience, and its purpose. If the marketing plan is for a small company and/or an internal audience, it may
      be quite informal. If it is intended for an external audience, such as bankers or potential investors, it must
      function as a persuasive tool. More attention will be given to sections that build confidence in the
      planners&#x2019; ability to carry it out, such as financial information, market research, and biographies of key
      personnel.</p>

    <p class="tx">Figure 9.1 summarizes the outline of a thorough marketing plan. An example of a marketing plan is
      included in the case study later in this chapter.</p>

    <p class="tx">To summarize the planning aspect of marketing management: This function requires the inputs of the
      analysis function in order to produce the marketing plan that guides the implementation and control functions. The
      marketing department&#x2019;s plans fit within the scope and strategies selected at the highest organizational
      level.</p>

    <p class="tx">Every marketing action must be described in detail, stating measurable goals and media plans,
      including estimated costs for each action. While several budgeting methods were described, the task-objective
      approach is recommended for its emphasis on specifying not just tactics but also anticipated results. This method
      facilitates evaluation later. Objectives, strategies, implementation plans, and budgets come together to form the
      marketing plan, often in the form of a written document, that governs marketers&#x2019; activities and priorities.

      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider </strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">In Chapter 6 you learned about brand-controlled message channels (paid or owned) and
        stakeholder-controlled channels (earned or shared). Planners can only address what they can control; thus, this
        discussion did not touch on stakeholder-controlled channels.</p>
      <p class="tx">How might planners respond to scenarios in which stakeholder-controlled channels become increasingly
        dominant?</p>
      <p class="tx">Marketing planning is becoming exponentially more complex as new message channels appear and
        consumers take more control of the discussion of companies and brands. Where is all this headed? Will it reach a
        point that advertising is simply not effective at reaching and persuading consumers? Will advertising as we know
        it disappear?</p>
    </div>


    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec9.5">9.5&#x2002;Functions of Marketing Management: Implementation and Control</h1>

    <p class="tx">In the analysis and planning functions, managers focus on finding effective strategies. As their
      attention turns to the functions of implementation and control, their focus shifts to carrying out the strategies
      they&#x2019;ve selected. Plenty of companies excel in strategy formulation but falter when it comes to
      implementation. Organizations that do both well can gain a significant competitive advantage.</p>

    <p class="tx">Success factors in implementation and control stem from the who, how, and why of those functions,
      including the following:</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><em>who</em> exerts the effort required, including individuals throughout the value chain, both
        inside and outside the company</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>how</em> the company organizes its functional structure, its decision systems, and its
        compensation programs to create a motivated and market-oriented <strong>organizational culture</strong></li>
      <li class="bl"><em>why</em> some tactics succeed and others fail, as judged by performance evaluation that leads
        to corrective action</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Applying the framework of the four functions of marketing management to the marketing process outlined
      in Chapter 2, three steps are involved in implementation and control: campaign development, execution, and
      measurement. Implementation alone could be the subject of an extended course of study. Aspects of marketing
      implementation come into play in the execution of strategies in each area of the marketing mix. That makes
      understanding control through metrics relevant to every student of marketing.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.5.1">Control Through Metrics</h2>
    <p class="tx">Fundamentally, marketing control consists of measuring and evaluating the results of marketing
      strategies and taking any needed corrective action to keep implementation on track. Marketers must </p>

    <a id="p310"></a>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">measure campaign performance in the marketplace; </li>
      <li class="bl">evaluate the cause of any variance between expected and actual performance; and </li>
      <li class="bl">take action to correct missteps, which may require changing tactics. </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">To measure performance while campaigns play out in the marketplace, marketers must decide what they
      will monitor. Measuring <strong>communications effect</strong> requires looking for outcomes that can be
      quantified, such as measuring advertising recall (how much of the message content its receivers remember) or
      measuring how many receivers subsequently completed an action like clicking on an ad link or calling a toll-free
      number. The problem with this approach is that it is difficult to relate these measures to sales. </p>

    <p class="tx">Measuring <strong>sales effect</strong> attempts to match the dollars spent on a campaign with its
      specific impact on sales revenues. This avoids the weakness of measuring communications effect but is still
      problematic, because marketers cannot control for other variables affecting outcomes. For an exaggerated example,
      consider a hardware store advertising gas-powered electrical generators in Topeka, Kansas. The day after a
      crippling tornado, sales of generators go through the roof&#x2014;but can the promotional campaign be credited
      with that sales spurt? No.</p>

    <p class="tx">But marketing practice has leaped forward from these fundamentals since the advent of online message
      channels and Big Data. With these advances, an entire marketing analytics industry has emerged and continues to
      grow. In many ways it is reshaping advertisers&#x2019; expectations and marketers&#x2019; practices. Marc de Swaan
      Arons, Frank van den Driest, and Keith Weed (2014) wrote in the July/August 2014 issue of <em>Harvard Business
        Review</em>:</p>

    <p class="ext">In the past decade, what marketers do to engage customers has changed almost beyond recognition. With
      the possible exception of information technology, we can&#x2019;t think of another discipline that has evolved so
      quickly. Tools and strategies that were cutting-edge just a few years ago are fast becoming obsolete, and new
      approaches are appearing every day. (para. 1)</p>

    <p class="tx">One change in marketing practice is the increasing attention paid to consumer behavior. Knowledge of
      what an individual consumer is doing where and when is no longer enough: High-performing companies
      &#x201C;integrate data on what consumers are doing with knowledge of why they&#x2019;re doing it, which yields new
      insights into consumers&#x2019; needs and how best to meet them&#x201D; (de Swaan Arons et al., 2014). </p>

    <p class="tx">Another change in control of marketing programs through metrics is the demand by corporations that
      their advertising agencies hold themselves accountable for measuring the impact of their advertising campaigns,
      regardless of the blend of media channels used. Thus large, medium, and even smaller advertising firms are
      adopting more sophisticated quantitative analysis techniques. A new ecosystem of service firms is emerging to
      serve this demand for accountability by providing information processing services (Jobs, Aukers, &amp; Gilfoil,
      2015).</p>

    <p class="tx">Are marketers ready for the challenge Big Data presents to measurement of marketing campaigns? As
      online message channels have become a crucial part of message strategy, integrated performance measurement
      naturally becomes more important. The pressure for greater accountability goes hand in hand with the need for IMC.
      With the advent of Big Data, we are even able to measure how one media channel lifts the performance of another
      (e.g., TV advertising bolstering social media effectiveness) to some extent (Nichols, 2013). </p>

    <a id="p311"></a>
    <p class="tx">Evaluating marketing strategy performance now requires an unprecedented level of sophistication and
      coordination among internal and external marketing roles. The marketing function has come a very long way from the
      &#x201C;creative revolution&#x201D; of the 1960s celebrated in the popular TV series <em>Mad Men</em>.</p>

    <p class="tx">Figure 9.2 represents the interlocking nature of the many metrics that play a role in managing the
      marketing effort. Explaining each of these metrics is beyond the scope of this course, but study of the many ways
      marketing activity can be monitored and thus controlled would be time well spent&#x2014;a grasp of metrics
      contributes to career success in the marketing field. Aspects of <strong>marketing metrics</strong> come into play
      in every area of the enterprise&#x2014;far beyond marketing, as Figure 9.2 shows.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec9.5.2">Marketing Dashboards</h2>
    <p class="tx">A <strong>marketing dashboard</strong> takes its metaphor from a car&#x2019;s instrument panel,
      appropriately enough, since there are many metrics that could provide information about a car&#x2019;s operation,
      but the dashboard is designed to show just those few that are crucial to safety and performance. A marketing
      dashboard, like a car&#x2019;s instrument panel, is designed to display essential information visually, so it can
      be understood at a glance. The dashboard makes it easy to know whether corrective action is needed. The
      &#x201C;gauges&#x201D; display values and trends tied to quantitative measures for evaluation designated by the
      marketing plan. </p>

    <div class="photo-right">
      <img id="img9.3" class="scaled" alt="Car instrument panel." title="Car instrument panel." src="images/9.3.jpg">
      <p class="credit">Rtdesignstudio/iStock/Getty Images Plus</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">A marketing dashboard displays essential information visually (like a car&#x2019;s
        instrument panel), making it easy to know whether the marketing function is operating properly.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Marketing dashboards have two purposes: (a) to make the fire hose of data from marketing metrics less
      overwhelming to individuals and (b) to provide a means to see essential data as close to real time as possible.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">To achieve the first purpose, dashboards must be tailored to different roles. A social media manager
      needs to monitor different values and trends than the leader of the sales force or the senior manager making
      strategic business unit and product portfolio decisions. For a marketing department focused primarily on direct
      mail strategies, a dashboard&#x2019;s gauges might show marketing campaign results including response rate, total
      sales, and average order value. For a marketing department using online promotions, the display might show the
      message open rate, unsubscribe rate, and conversion (response rate). For social media analytics, the display might
      include search terms, top social platforms and keywords, and referrers.</p>

    <p class="tx">What decisions are individuals responsible for, and thus, what data or trend insights might be helpful
      to them? <strong>Key performance indicators (KPIs)</strong>&#x2014;statistics such as number of new orders or
      unique website visitors, for example&#x2014;are used to measure a firm&#x2019;s performance in specific critical
      areas. KPIs earn their &#x201C;key&#x201D; designation because the actions they measure, if not properly
      performed, would lead to strategic weakness. The design of a marketing dashboard takes into account which KPIs
      would be most useful in monitoring marketing performance based on specific roles. All key business stakeholders
      should have access to a marketing dashboard tailored to their role. </p>

    <p class="tx">To achieve the second purpose, dashboards should focus on leading indicators, as discussed in Chapter
      8. The speedometer on your car&#x2019;s dashboard would be of no use to you if it only showed what speed the
      vehicle was going yesterday. Unfortunately, too many of today&#x2019;s dashboards draw their numbers from
      accounting mechanisms, which produce information that is already historical. Data displayed on a dashboard should
      be as current as possible. A weekly update is better than monthly; daily is better than weekly; hourly is better
      still. Advances in communication technology are making near-real-time marketing data available from point-of-sale
      transactions, Internet activity, and more. This is increasing the value of marketing dashboards for control in
      marketing management.</p>

    <a id="p313"></a>
    <p class="tx">This interactive diagram shows one possible marketing dashboard, developed for a major retailer.</p>

    <p class="tx">As data-driven marketing has grown, so has the ability to measure performance, increasing the
      significance of marketing metrics that quantify trends, dynamics, and characteristics of market performance.
      Metrics make it possible to compare observations across sectors and time periods. &#x201C;If you can&#x2019;t
      measure it, you can&#x2019;t manage it,&#x201D; goes the quote attributed to various management experts (Farris,
      Bendle, Pfeifer, &amp; Reibstein, 2010). A few of the metrics that business managers use to monitor performance
      are</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">customer perceptions,</li>
      <li class="bl">market share,</li>
      <li class="bl">revenues,</li>
      <li class="bl">profitability,</li>
      <li class="bl">sales force performance,</li>
      <li class="bl">price sensitivity,</li>
      <li class="bl">advertising effectiveness, and</li>
      <li class="bl">lifetime customer value.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Marketers are increasingly turning to customer-centered metrics like customer acquisition, retention,
      and lifetime value to overcome the weaknesses of measuring communications effect and sales effect (Kotler &amp;
      Armstrong, 2006).</p>

    <p class="tx">The most commonly used metric of organizational success is return on investment, introduced in Chapter
      2. To calculate ROI, marketers must quantify the gain (return) on a specific activity and the investment in that
      activity. One common expression of the ROI formula is:</p>

    <p class="ext">Return on Investment = (Gain from Investment &#x2013; Cost of Investment)/Cost of Investment</p>

    <p class="tx">When managers attempt to break out investments in marketing and attribute sales effect to them, the
      metric is referred to as return on marketing investment (ROMI), also introduced in Chapter 2. Its components are
      identified in Figure 9.3. </p>

    <a id="p314"></a>
    <div class="figure-box">
      <h4 class="figure-name">Figure 9.3: Return on marketing investment</h4>
      <h5 class="figure-title">Return on marketing investment focuses on customer-centered metrics such as customer
        attraction, retention, and lifetime value.</h5>

        title="Diagram of ROMI, or return on marketing investment." class="figure" id="fig_9.3">
      <p class="credit_left"><strong><em>Kotler, P., &amp; Armstrong, G. (2006). Principles of Marketing , 11th Ed.,
            &#xA9;2006. Reprinted by permission of Pearson Education, Inc., New York, New York.</em></strong></p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">As marketers come under more pressure to &#x201C;show ROI&#x201D; on their activities, we will need to
      improve on the ROMI metric. Both the ROI and ROMI calculations depend on what is included in gains and costs. For
      example, one marketer might compare two products by dividing gross profits from each by the marketing expenses of
      each, including every component in the media plan. Another marketer might compare the same two products by
      dividing the net profits from the two products by the total value of all resources required to make as well as
      market each. Marketers need to assign dollar values to intangibles, such as improved customer satisfaction, to
      quantify ROMI. There is no one right method, and this flexibility has a downside: ROI and ROMI calculations can be
      easily manipulated to suit different purposes. When using these metrics, marketers must make sure the inputs used
      are clearly stated.</p>

    <p class="tx">Measuring ROMI is important, but it is destined to be inexact because the goal of marketing
      communications is rarely to directly affect sales&#x2014;expressed as &#x201C;return&#x201D; in this formula.
      Rather, marketing activity is intended to initiate a series of responses that build over time to an eventual
      effect on sales (Taylor, 2010). And as IMC becomes &#x201C;business as usual,&#x201D; estimating ROMI becomes more
      inexact, because of the complex and subtle interactions between different marketing programs and campaigns. The
      gain from investment might show up in any number of ways following a marketing thrust. If brand ambassadors are
      working the crowd at a rock concert offering free shots of an energy drink, while at the same time text messages
      offering purchase discounts go to the brand&#x2019;s customers who have opted in to receive messages and whose
      mobile devices are near the concert arena, which strategy gets credit for any sales lift generated&#x2014;the
      brand ambassador program or the text message campaign? Bottom line&#x2014;marketers must use ROMI responsibly.
      Allocating budgets based on comparing positive scores on ROMI would be a questionable practice, but eliminating
      campaigns and programs that have earned a negative ROMI would very likely make sense (Farris et al., 2010). </p>

    <a id="p315"></a>
    <p class="tx">Using the right marketing metrics significantly adds to the precision of measuring campaign
      performance, the first step in marketing control. A marketing dashboard makes it easier to spot variance from
      expected performance sooner. This facilitates the second step in marketing control: evaluating the cause of
      variations. Based on the outcome of that step, marketing managers decide whether to take corrective action while
      the campaign is still under way or merely apply insights from that experience to the next iteration of strategic
      planning.</p>

    <p class="tx">To conclude, implementation covers the many tasks related to executing marketing mix strategies
      regarding product, place, price, and promotion. Control of all that activity is facilitated by marketing
      dashboards that allow managers to monitor performance using specific KPIs in as close to real time as possible.

    <h2 class="Case-Study h2" id="ch09casestudy"><strong>Case Study: </strong><em>Sample Marketing Plan for Cats &amp;
        Cameos</em></h2>

    <p class="tx"><em>The following marketing plan is based on a real situation. Details have been changed to protect
        proprietary information.</em></p>

    <p class="tx">The founder has identified a product that leverages several social trends, including an increase in
      pet ownership and strong sales in luxury good categories despite slow recovery from the economic recession. The
      business idea takes advantage of Marketing 3.0 consumers&#x2019; desire to partner with companies in cocreation of
      value. The plan was written to address an audience of potential investors.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="ch09casestudy.1">Executive Summary</h2>
    <p class="tx">Cats &amp; Cameos is a start-up company based in suburban Chicago. The founder is a semiretired owner
      of a boutique graphic design studio and avid pet lover interested in developing a new business. This plan
      describes Year One of the launch of Cats &amp; Cameos.</p>

    <a id="p316"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="ch09casestudy.2">Current Situation</h2>
    <p class="tx">Cats &amp; Cameos is a start-up company that proposes to design, manufacture, and sell paired designer
      accessories for cats and their owners. Cats &amp; Cameos will be involved in three distinct activities:</p>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">Designing cameo brooches in pairs consisting of stylish ID tags for cats with a portrait of their
        owners, and cameo brooches for owners with an image of their cat&#x2019;s breed or a custom portrait of their
        cat. The products create an aesthetic and emotional bond between pet and owner.</li>
      <li class="nl">Producing the accessories, using third-party manufacturers.</li>
      <li class="nl">Marketing and selling the accessory pair as a gift item. The set will initially be sold directly to
        the public online only and may be sold later through pet boutiques and gift stores.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="h2" id="ch09casestudy.3">Market</h2>
    <p class="tx">Pet products are a $40-billion-plus-a-year industry. More than one third of American households
      include one or more cats. Gift giving to pets and their owners continues to rise&#x2014;with 8 out of 10 cat
      owners buying cats gifts for birthdays.</p>

    <p class="tx">Cats &amp; Cameos targets a high-income niche: Households with incomes of $100,000 or more represent
      more than one third of pet product customers, and these households spend double the annual average on pet products
      and services, according to consumer surveys.</p>

    <p class="tx">The prime target is a woman in her 40s with a household income of more than $100,000, living in or
      near a large city. These households spend more than $800 a year&#x2014;more than twice the average&#x2014;on pet
      products, according to the Consumer Expenditure Survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2018).</p>

    <p class="tx">A secondary target consists of non-pet owners who will see the product as an ideal gift item for the
      primary target.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="ch09casestudy.4">Product</h2>
    <p class="tx">The products are tastefully designed. The products are so unique that they give cats and their owners
      the opportunity to enjoy being the center of attention.</p>

    <p class="tx">The base product pair, the Cameo Set, includes a cat ID tag that resembles a high-quality cameo but is
      manufactured from durable plastic resin to withstand wear and tear. The low-relief sculptural portrait of the
      owner is created from a photo provided by the owner, altered in Photoshop, and manufactured to create a
      three-dimensional cameo. The cat ID tag is paired with a matching high-quality cameo brooch for the owner, also
      made of resin, with a three-dimensional image of the cat breed selected from a catalog of over 300 popular breeds.
      The Cameo Set is manufactured in Cordoba, Argentina.</p>

    <a id="p317"></a>
    <p class="tx">The added-value product pair is the Heritage Deluxe Cameo Set, in which the owner&#x2019;s pin is a
      true customized cameo with an image of the owner&#x2019;s special pet, carved from carnelian shell by artisans in
      Torre del Greco, Italy, and destined to become a family heirloom.</p>

    <p class="tx">An option with either of the product pairs is the MyFinder RFID tag. An RFID chip can be embedded in
      the cat&#x2019;s cameo tag to provide location data to the owner if the pet and owner become separated. The
      integral battery in the optional tag provides 3 to 5 years of continuous use.</p>

    <p class="tx">The product line is designed to appeal to the urban, fashion-conscious cat owner.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="ch09casestudy.7">Objectives and Issues</h2>

    <h3 class="h3" id="ch09casestudy.7.1">First-Year Objectives</h3>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Capture 1% of the estimated population of 44.8 million households with cats via direct sales
        online.</li>
      <li class="bl">Build social media followers to 1,000 plus.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3 class="h3" id="ch09casestudy.7.2">Second-Year Objectives</h3>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Capture an additional 1% of those 44.8 million households via direct sales online.</li>
      <li class="bl">Expand sales to retailers.</li>
      <li class="bl">Build social media followers to 4,000 plus.</li>
    </ul>

    <a id="p319"></a>
    <h3 class="h3" id="ch09casestudy.7.3">Issues</h3>
    <p class="tx">The founder has identified three main concerns:</p>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">The sluggish economy may hinder sales.</li>
      <li class="bl">The product/price strategy leaves a gap between the low-end and high-end </li>
      <li class="bl">offerings.</li>
      <li class="bl">Capturing the attention of consumers in the target market and cat-fashion-world media will require
        significant investment of marketing effort.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2" id="ch09casestudy.8">Marketing Strategies</h2>

    <h3 class="h3" id="ch09casestudy.8.1">Positioning</h3>
    <p class="tx">The value proposition for Cats &amp; Cameos answers the question &#x201C;Which reason to buy our
      offering matters most to our target customers?&#x201D; with the promise of an attention-getting article of couture
      for both pet and owner so distinctive that others will be jealous. The additional advantage of the RFID location
      function creates a promise of security&#x2014;with style.</p>


    <h3 class="h3" id="ch09casestudy.8.2">Product Strategy</h3>
    <p class="tx">The <em>core product</em> is a pair of couture cameos for owner and cat to wear. Each is styled to
      resemble traditional cameo pins. The pet&#x2019;s cameo is a durable plastic resin ID tag with a custom image of
      the owner. An RFID tag is available as an add-on option. The owner&#x2019;s cameo pin is either a generic image of
      the cat&#x2019;s breed in plastic resin or a portrait of the specific pet, carved in heirloom-quality carnelian
      shell. The benefit delivered by these accessories is celebration of the pet&#x2013;owner relationship with a
      luxury aesthetic.</p>

    <p class="tx">The <em>expanded product</em> is about possession of a well-crafted &#x201C;little luxury&#x201D; in
      which the purchaser has played a part in the design, through customization of the image of pet and owner. All Cats
      &amp; Cameos products come with a warranty of durability and a certificate of authenticity.</p>

    <p class="tx">The <em>product concept</em> is a perspective that the bond between pets and owners is emotionally
      similar to that between family members and deserves celebration. This product helps connect owners and their pets
      in an appealing way, while making a stylish statement. Cats &amp; Cameos takes a socially responsible approach to
      sourcing product manufacturing, working with artisans around the globe to improve their economic stability while
      providing high-quality craft items to buyers. The founder will create an excellent shopping experience for
      customers by engaging in conversations with shoppers whenever possible, even via live chat with website visitors.
      Tucked into each purchase shipped will be a handwritten thank-you note.</p>


    <h3 class="h3" id="ch09casestudy.8.3">Pricing Strategy</h3>
    <p class="tx">Cats &amp; Cameos&#x2019; philosophy is to use price to communicate a high-end, quality product; the
      price point will be at the higher end when compared with similar gift items. The owner will monitor the industry
      to remain competitive but is confident that the product, because of the concept, will generate interest among
      those who can afford luxuries big and small.</p>

    <a id="p320"></a>
    <p class="tx">The Cameo Set is value priced, while the Heritage Deluxe Cameo Set&#x2019;s price reflects its
      heirloom quality and customization; this is a truly one-of-a-kind piece of jewelry.</p>

    <p class="tx">While production costs will dictate the final price points, the owner anticipates</p>

    <ul class="bl">

      <li class="bl">the Cameo Set will sell for about $60,</li>
      <li class="bl">the Heritage Deluxe Cameo Set will sell for about $800, and</li>
      <li class="bl">the RFID option can be added to either product for about $50.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3 class="h3" id="ch09casestudy.8.4">Distribution Strategy</h3>
    <p class="tx">Cats &amp; Cameos will be based in the owner&#x2019;s home office in the suburban Chicago area. Later,
      as the business grows, rental space/storage may be necessary to house inventory and accommodate additional
      employees.</p>

    <p class="tx">During the initial stage of the business, the products will be available to customers exclusively
      online via a website. At a future phase of the business, the owner will explore distributing products through
      retail outlets.</p>

    <p class="tx">Channel partners at the launch of Cats &amp; Cameos include a manufacturer in Cordoba, Argentina, for
      the plastic resin products and artisans in Torre del Greco, Italy, for the heirloom-quality cameos. In the future,
      retailers and distributors may join the distribution channel.</p>


    <h3 class="h3" id="ch09casestudy.8.5">Marketing Communications Strategy </h3>
    <p class="tx">The promotional components for Cats &amp; Cameos will include a website plus advertising in <em>Cat
        Fancy</em>, <em>Cats USA</em>, <em>Natural Cat</em>, <em>Pet Style News</em>, <em>Pet Fashion Showcase</em>, and
      local area gift guides.</p>

    <p class="tx">The owner will conduct public relations outreach to pet-niche magazines.</p>

    <p class="tx">The owner will create and actively participate in social media communities on Facebook, Twitter,
      Pinterest, and Tribe.</p>

    <p class="tx">While the company is organized as an online retailer, the owner intends to create relationships with
      local retailers to interact with consumers and learn more about their perceptions of the products&#x2019; value
      and benefits.</p>

    <p class="tx">The owner will attend pet product and retail gift trade shows to create buzz and interest for Cats
      &amp; Cameos&#x2019; product, and to explore sales to retailers.</p>


    <h3 class="h3" id="ch09casestudy.8.6">Marketing Research</h3>
    <p class="tx">The owner will monitor website usage to gain insights into which pages/products hold visitors&#x2019;
      attention; an online exit survey will add to understanding of consumers and the Cats &amp; Cameos value
      proposition.</p>

    <a id="p321"></a>
    <p class="tx">The owner will conduct focus groups with cat owners in the target market demographic before placing an
      initial order for demonstration products.</p>

    <p class="tx">The owner plans to test-market the product line by taking demonstration products to local and regional
      stores.</p>


    <h3 class="h3" id="ch09casestudy.8.7">Marketing Organization</h3>
    <p class="tx">The start-up company will be operated by the owner without employees. As growth warrants, employees
      will be added to fulfill functions of finance and operations; the owner will remain the lead marketer.</p>

    <p class="tx">The company will focus on B2C selling online but will also develop a B2B model selling to local
      retailers.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="ch09casestudy.9">Implementation Plans</h2>
    <p class="tx">The founder&#x2019;s focus for the launch year will be on raising awareness of, and interest in, Cats
      &amp; Cameos.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Challenge Question</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Even as a small start-up business, in today&#x2019;s marketing environment Cats &amp; Cameos must
        meet the challenge of using an IMC approach. Put yourself in the position of a marketing consultant asked to
        advise Cats &amp; Cameos&#x2019; founder. How would you suggest she address this challenge&#x2014;for example,
        should she emphasize a push communication model, pull, or both? How does IMC impact her execution of the four
        functions of marketing management&#x2014;analysis, planning, implementation, and control?</p>
    </div>

    <a id="p323"></a>
    <h2 class="eoc-h2" id="ch09keyideas">Key Ideas to Remember</h2>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">The IMC approach requires integration across every business function and resource involved in
        sales, marketing, and/or corporate communications. Seamless teamwork is essential. Managing the marketing
        function in this era of IMC means coordinating efforts so the target audience receives a single consistent
        message.</li>
      <li class="bl">Analysis provides a basis for selecting strategies to execute by grounding planning in the
        realities of the business environment, the industry, the company, and customers. Big Data becomes relevant to
        strategy when companies must deal with rapid proliferation of data, need to exploit data in real time, or use
        data types that are not easy to automatically index, like video.</li>
      <li class="bl">Planning guides purposeful action by defining scope, objectives, goals, and action plans. Part of a
        strategic plan is a marketing section describing all actions planned or underway. Media planners must specify
        reach, frequency, and impact goals; message channel usage; media vehicle selection; and timing, considering the
        target consumer, value proposition, and specific media vehicles to be used, down to the details of how many ads
        run, and in what pattern, over a given time.</li>
      <li class="bl">A new ecosystem of service firms is emerging to serve the demand by corporations that their
        advertising agencies hold themselves accountable for measuring the&#xA0;impact of their advertising campaigns,
        regardless of the blend of media channels&#xA0;used.</li>
      <li class="bl">Implementation of marketing plans leads to actions that carry out marketing mix strategies.
        Marketing dashboards that allow managers to monitor performance are helpful in monitoring and evaluating
        performance of all that marketing action. </li>
    </ul>


    <h2 class="eoc-h2" id="ch09criticalthinking">Critical-Thinking Questions</h2>

    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">Pick one of the three reasons IMC has become imperative and describe its potential implications for
        Cats &amp; Cameos.</li>
      <li class="nl">Describe the four functions of management. In your answer, identify how a marketing manager might
        realize when it is time to focus on one function or another. </li>
      <li class="nl">Imagine you are consulting with a manager of a business that sells cleaning supplies to nursing
        homes. Your client wants to develop a marketing plan but has a small budget for marketing his business. How
        would you show your client the benefits of a marketing plan? What aspects of a marketing plan could be scaled
        back or eliminated for this client&#x2019;s situation?</li>
      <li class="nl">Customer perceptions, market share, revenues, profitability, sales force performance, price
        sensitivity, advertising effectiveness, and lifetime customer value were listed as KPIs of marketing
        performance. Identify which are measures of communications effect and which are measures of sales effect.</li>
      <li class="nl">Many people have an idea for a new product or service that arose from frustration with an existing
        offering. Do you? Try performing a SWOT analysis on your product or service idea.</li>

    <h1 class="h1" id="ch10intro">Introduction</h1>


    <p class="tx">The moment you begin working in marketing, you assume responsibility for practicing high ethical
      standards with regard to your responsibility to the public, the marketing profession, the company that employs
      you, and the industry in which it functions. In addition, you must take responsibility for yourself&#x2014;your
      individual performance on the job, your contribution to workplace teams, and your preparation for advancement. In
      this chapter you&#x2019;ll learn to apply what you&#x2019;ve learned about marketing to managing your personal
      brand while on the job.</p>

    <p class="tx">This chapter approaches responsible marketing beginning with a wide-angle view of the effect of
      marketing practices on the public and the planet. Then the lens narrows with each section in turn to focus on
      concerns of the profession, organizational employers, and individual contributors. </p>

    <p class="tx">The marketing field offers careers in many roles, suitable to a wide variety of personalities from
      analytical to creative. Where will you find your niche? This chapter ends with an exploration of the newest skills
      needed and the emerging locales where marketing practitioners will thrive. With an understanding of your role in
      responsible industry practices, this chapter concludes our study of the basic principles of marketing.</p>


    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec10.1">10.1&#x2002;Responsibility to the Public</h1>

    <p class="tx">Over the past 50 years, the Super Bowl has become a shared American cultural experience, but not just
      because of love for football. Millions of people tune in to watch the advertisements. Since the rise of social
      media, Super Bowl advertising has become the centerpiece of integrated marketing campaigns that extend over many
      months (Sanburn, 2016). On social media, we&#x2019;re drawn to the many ads that require our clicks to reveal a
      reward of some kind, whether it&#x2019;s the punch line to a joke or our score on a game or quiz. We&#x2019;ve
      grown accustomed to the blurring of the lines between entertainment and promotions, and not just on television.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">As marketing communications move into new message channels, new forms of promotions have proliferated
      that bear little resemblance to paid advertising. The many forms of &#x201C;advertainment&#x201D; in
      today&#x2019;s social media (branded videos, quizzes, and so on) place the burden on the public to decide whether
      products are being pitched&#x2014;and in which instances that is appropriate behavior for marketers. When you step
      from being part of the public to a role in the marketing profession, you become ethically bound to serve the
      public&#x2019;s well-being. That will, at times, make you the target of criticism.</p>



    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.1.1">Criticisms of the Marketing Function</h2>
    <p class="tx">The marketing field is frequently criticized for its negative impact on individual consumers, other
      businesses, and society at large. Marketers naturally present offerings in the best light possible, and sometimes
      this crosses the line into false representation. Marketing messages can raise unrealistic expectations of what a
      product or service will do for consumers&#x2014;consider the prescription drug commercials in which the images
      show happy, healthy people, but the voiceover lists many possible negative side effects. Advertising imagery can
      create unhealthy cultural ideals, like the unattainably thin women in fashion illustrations. Because children are
      highly susceptible to advertising, it can influence them in negative ways, from food preferences (Fruity Pebbles,
      anyone?) to risky behavior&#x2014;just ask Joe Camel (Jenson, 2017). Over the years there have been enough
      instances of unethical behavior by businesses to warrant not just criticism but specific legislation designed to
      constrain damaging marketing practices. </p>

    <a id="p327"></a>
    <p class="tx">Critics of marketing have charged that some companies use unfair practices to harm other businesses;
      some of these practices are listed in Table 10.1. Legislation designed to limit unfair practices exists, but it
      cannot keep up with emerging methods. In December 2011 online retailer Amazon encouraged customers to report local
      retailers&#x2019; prices using a specially designed smartphone app and rewarded those who did so with discounts on
      purchases of those items. The move, while legal, was met with a barrage of criticism from the press and other
      businesses (Mandelbaum, 2011).</p>

      advantage. Each of the above may qualify as illegal depending on the extent and circumstances of the practice. See
      Chapter 8 for more on the legal factors affecting marketing practices.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing&#x2019;s impact on society has also been widely criticized. The emphasis on promotion of
      goods and services in the developed world has been accused of fostering materialism and creating visual pollution,
      while contributing little to social well-being. Critics point out that the market system gives industries too much
      power over the public interest without commensurate responsibility for the public&#x2019;s health and safety.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.1.2">In Defense of Marketing </h2>
    <p class="tx">Marketing has indeed earned some of the criticism leveled at it&#x2014;but where would we be without
      it? Without marketing communications, how would prospective buyers learn about the goods and services that might
      fill their needs and desires? What financial model would replace paid marketing communications to support the many
      businesses and organizations that are currently underwritten by advertisers?</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing has value. For individuals, it assumes economic importance, allowing companies to thrive in
      a competitive market and thus provide employment. Promotional activity leads to higher sales that in turn make
      more offerings more affordable to more people. Advertising subsidizes much of the information and entertainment
      available in contemporary society (Kurtz, 2010). Without advertising to cover the costs of news gathering, we
      would have much less access to responsible journalism. Without sponsorships and product placement, we would see
      fewer movies and television programs. </p>

    <p class="tx">For businesses, marketing activity leads to new customers, increased brand loyalty, and greater
      stability and growth. Without these important benefits, businesses would not be able to provide the economic
      advantages they do.</p>

    <p class="tx">Other organizations, including nonprofit groups and governmental agencies, frequently deploy the
      techniques of marketing communication to achieve aims that benefit the public. As discussed in Chapter 3, selling
      the idea of behavioral change is so effective and widely practiced that it has its own term: social marketing.
      Table 10.2 summarizes these arguments.</p>

    <p class="table-footnote"><em>Note.</em> Marketing has value for individuals, businesses, and the public.</p>



    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.1.3">Unacceptable Marketing Practices</h2>
    <p class="tx">Marketing has power. Some uses of that power fall outside acceptable boundaries, such as manipulation
      of vulnerable consumers (including the very old and very young, the mentally ill, and others at risk), invasion of
      privacy, and theft of personal information. For example, the blurring of the distinction between advertising and
      entertainment has been an increasing concern where advertising to children is concerned. Food companies have come
      under fire for their use of entertaining online games and smartphone apps to build relationships with young
      children (Richtel, 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">The position of the advertising industry is that marketers are obligated to gain the trust of children
      and their parents through honest messages, while parents must accept responsibility for monitoring their
      children&#x2019;s media habits and developing their consumer literacy. A strategic alliance of major advertising
      trade associations formed the Children&#x2019;s Advertising Review Unit in 1974 to promote responsibility in
      children&#x2019;s advertising. The group&#x2019;s guidelines, which address the level of children&#x2019;s
      knowledge, sophistication, and maturity, apply to all advertising in print, radio, and broadcast and cable
      television and on the Internet directed to children under age 12 (Advertising Education Foundation, 2012).</p>

    <p class="tx">Misuse of personal data is another issue that has been an object of public concern. Data breaches are
      the most obvious danger; even the most dependable and established companies on the Internet, such as Amazon and
      eBay, have not proved capable of keeping personal data safe (Perlroth, 2012). Financial transactions conducted
      over the Internet and profiles on social media sites were once the main vulnerabilities for personal data. But as
      devices have proliferated that collect information from individuals, new vulnerabilities&#x2014;and
      questions&#x2014;have arisen. How will that trove of personal information be used?</p>

    <p class="tx">Most consumers are aware that Google analyzes search terms to discover trends&#x2014;information it
      sells for profit. In 2009 Google researchers worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create
      a predictive model called Google Flu Trends that can predict regional flu activity with a lag of only about a day.
      The model is based on flu-related web searches tied to searchers&#x2019; Internet addresses that indicate their
      physical location. That Flu Trends report, originally intended to serve public health, became the cornerstone of
      an advertising campaign for Vicks in late 2011, when the company introduced the Behind Ear Thermometer.
      Vicks&#x2019;s advertising agency developed a mobile campaign to reach mothers (the primary purchasers of
      thermometers) using mobile apps like Pandora that collect demographic data about users. By marrying
      Google&#x2019;s Flu Trends reports to the demographic data on mobile app users, Vicks targeted its campaign for
      the Behind Ear Thermometer. Vicks sent its ads only to smartphones belonging to mothers living within 2 miles of
      retailers carrying the Vicks thermometers. Each ad noted the location of the nearest store selling the product.
    </p>

    <a id="p330"></a>
    <p class="tx">Is Vicks being helpful or creepy by taking its data-driven mobile campaign to such a degree of target
      marketing? Advertising commentators felt that because the information is useful and relevant, and the fine-tuned
      behavioral targeting is not overly obvious to recipients, the campaign does not cross the line into misuse of data
      (Newman, 2011f). You may feel differently.</p>

    <p class="tx">With the rise of artificial intelligence&#x2013;enabled devices like the Amazon Echo and Google Home,
      consumers have invited &#x201C;always on&#x201D; listening devices into their lives. These Internet-connected
      devices promise to increase convenience but can easily be exploited by hackers for surveillance or data theft.
      Sometimes the manufacturers themselves are the ones behaving badly: In 2017 Vizio was fined $2.2 million for
      selling &#x201C;smart&#x201D; televisions that tracked users&#x2019; viewing habits without their knowledge and
      sharing that information without customers&#x2019; permission (McGoogan, 2017). </p>

    <p class="tx">Acceptable marketing practices will always be a moving target reflecting changing technology and
      societal norms. By its nature, the marketing discipline will always be pushing into new territory in its search to
      break through existing advertising clutter and command target consumers&#x2019; attention. As new marketing
      methods appear, the process of judging what practices are unethical will continue.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.1.4">Ethical Marketing</h2>
    <p class="tx">Companies that serve consumers who share a Marketing 3.0 outlook will be expected to practice a
      philosophy of <strong>ethical marketing</strong> that requires them to be socially responsible and culturally
      sensitive. Ethical marketing serves the sustainability of the entire market system&#x2014;not merely corporate
      self-interest. A company following ethical marketing practices will</p>

    <a id="p331"></a>
    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">organize itself around its customers&#x2019; point of view and perceptions of value;</li>
      <li class="nl">seek continuous improvement and innovation; and</li>
      <li class="nl">reflect a triple bottom line of profitability, environmental health, and social progress.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">Financial profit cannot take priority over social or environmental impacts. Ethical marketing benefits
      consumers, companies, and society as a whole (Mish &amp; Scammon, 2010).</p>

    <p class="tx">Some companies go so far as to organize around a mission of achieving philanthropic
      goals&#x2014;placing social progress or environmental health before profits, while maintaining a commitment to all
      three measures of the triple bottom line. This structure, which may be for-profit or nonprofit, is known as the
      <strong>social enterprise model</strong>. This model is particularly necessary in emerging markets where social
      needs are greatest. &#x201C;Eradicating poverty is arguably humankind&#x2019;s biggest challenge&#x201D; (Kotler,
      2010, p. xiii), write the authors of <em>Marketing 3.0</em>. Promotion of entrepreneurship, more than governmental
      or nonprofit aid groups, will be the force that lifts the world&#x2019;s poor toward greater security. Why?
      Because corporations already operate in a market structure that leads to economic development. By bringing this
      structure to the developing world, even if only to expand markets for their offerings, corporations can play a
      major role in achieving greater human rights and well-being for the world&#x2019;s poor
      (Kotler, 2010).</p>

      brings business and nonprofit organizations together: Each PartnerShop is a Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s scoop shop
      that is owned and operated by a community-based nonprofit organization. The Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s company
      waives its standard franchise fee and provides additional support to help its nonprofit partners&#x2019; scoop
      shops succeed. Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s (2018) has targeted youth development organizations to open PartnerShops,
      recognizing that scoop shops offer excellent job opportunities for young people. </p>

    <p class="tx">In the United States two legal forms of business organization address the needs of firms that want to
      pursue a social enterprise model. One is the <strong>benefit corporation</strong>. This classification offers an
      alternative to the traditional for-profit corporation with its mandate to maximize profits for the benefit of
      shareholders. A benefit corporation puts the focus on commitment to pursuing a goal other than profit. In benefit
      corporations, members of the board of directors are required to consider nonfinancial stakeholders as well as the
      financial interests of shareholders. Examples of benefit corporations include the online craft bazaar Etsy, online
      glasses retailer Warby Parker, and outdoor gear company Patagonia. To be certified as a benefit corporation, or B
      corp, companies are scored on an assessment and take steps to meet certain legal requirements that vary by state.
      Companies must then get recertified every 2 years (McGregor, 2015). </p>

    <p class="tx">The other legal form is the <strong>low-profit limited liability company (L3C)</strong>, a structure
      for for-profit companies with a social mission as their primary goal. This form is available to social
      entrepreneurs who seek the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional limited liability company (LLC), the social
      benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding/positioning advantages of a social enterprise (Lane, 2014).
      An example of an L3C company is the Mission Center in St. Louis. The Mission Center provides &#x201C;back
      office&#x201D; services such as accounting, human resources, and insurance functions to small nonprofit
      organizations that do not have the scale or willingness to undertake those functions on their own (Cohen, 2014).
    </p>

    <a id="p332"></a>
    <p class="tx">Whether or not companies organize as social enterprises, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the
      foundation on which they build ethical marketing practices. This form of self-regulation is built into a
      company&#x2019;s business model and corporate values. It takes the form of written policies to ensure compliance
      with the spirit (not just the letter) of laws governing marketing practice and to the unwritten law of ethical
      standards. The goal of a company&#x2019;s CSR policy is to embrace responsibility for its actions, to encourage
      positive impact (Wood, 1991).</p>

    <p class="tx">Can ethical marketing be sustainable, given the intense competition in most industries? Can
      organizations remain competitive while committed to social responsibility? Yes&#x2014;if they can find a structure
      that supports caring without creating competitive disadvantage. Even if the moral and ethical legitimacy of social
      responsibility is evident, the fact remains that such initiatives cost money, and organizations face an economic
      imperative to remain profitable, which means remaining competitive.</p>

    <p class="tx">Competition solely on price leaves little room for caring. The company that can differentiate its
      offerings sufficiently can operate &#x201C;in a class by itself&#x201D; and thus afford commitment to social
      responsibility. The business case for ethics-driven practices can be compelling: Such policies create competitive
      advantage, attract investment, reduce cost and risk of legal fines or government intervention, attract and
      motivate better talent, and foster innovation (Chavez, 2011).</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.1.5">Ethical Marketing in Action</h2>
    <p class="tx">The marketing approach of British chocolate manufacturer Green &amp; Black&#x2019;s presents an
      example of ethical marketing delivering competitive advantage. The chocolate industry has come to resemble the
      wine industry, with proliferating varieties and price points and sources from corporate conglomerates to boutique
      producers. In this crowded marketplace, Green &amp; Black&#x2019;s chose to focus on raising consumers&#x2019;
      awareness of its organic offerings and Fair Trade certification.</p>

    <p class="tx">Green &amp; Black&#x2019;s marketers chose experiential and digital marketing tactics. From April to
      October 2011, the company created an experience at food and wine events in five U.S. cities with booths designed
      to foster engagement with attendees as brand ambassadors who introduced flavors, explained ingredients, and
      entertained with dessert-building demonstrations. It also hosted brief seminars about the company&#x2019;s global
      sourcing and Fair Trade credentials. The farmers who supply cocoa to Green &amp; Black&#x2019;s receive a
      guaranteed minimum price, plus additional funds to invest in their countries&#x2019; environmental, social, and
      economic development (Birkner, 2011). The campaign created a brand relationship with consumers that lifted Green
      &amp; Black&#x2019;s above commodity status.</p>

    <a id="p333"></a>
    <p class="tx">Other examples of successful ethical marketing initiatives include the following:</p>



    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Every year, Toms Shoes hosts One Day Without Shoes, an event designed to raise awareness about
        global poverty and funds to combat it. (The company founder, Blake Mycoskie, had visited Argentina and noticed
        many barefoot children, leading to his idea for a shoe company that provided a free pair of new shoes to youth
        in developing countries for every pair sold.) Brand enthusiasts observe the day by going without shoes and
        posting photos to social media with the hashtag #WithoutShoes. Toms gives away a new pair for every hashtagged
        photo, up to a million. User-generated content is central to the initiative, which in 2016 resulted in over
        27,000 new pairs of shoes delivered to children worldwide (Rogers, 2016).</li>
      <li class="bl">Planters, the snack nut brand owned by Kraft Foods, paid for and developed parks in low-income
        neighborhoods in New Orleans, Manhattan, and Washington, D.C. The offbeat parks feature peanut-inspired
        landscape designs, plantings of fruit and nut trees, and rain gardens. Experiential marketing events accompanied
        the ribbon cuttings, with the Nutmobile (a peanut-shaped vehicle powered by biodiesel) and Mr. Peanut himself,
        in signature top hat and monocle (Foderaro, 2011).</li>

    <p class="tx">As has been shown, many marketers and the corporate leaders they report to have taken seriously their
      responsibility to the public&#x2019;s best interest. This comes in response to criticism of marketing for
      contributing to confusion between advertising and entertainment and engaging in practices with negative impacts on
      individual consumers, businesses, and society. In defense of marketing, we must recognize its contributions to a
      healthy marketplace. Promotional activity leads to growth and stability for companies; jobs, information, and
      entertainment for individuals; and marketing of ideas that lead to positive behavioral changes in&#xA0;society.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Ethical marketing and the social enterprise business model have emerged to place value on the triple
      bottom line of profits, people, and planet over profits alone. Marketers are discovering how to use social
      responsibility to establish competitive differentiation that lifts them above competing solely on price.</p>

    <p class="tx">As the examples cited illustrate, many companies are now actively responding to the major forces
      identified with Marketing 3.0. They are carving out positions of authentic competitive differentiation, engaging
      consumers in meaningful ways, and serving human and environmental welfare through social initiatives.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec10.2">10.2&#x2002;Responsibility to Our Planet</h1>

    <p class="tx">In Chapter 8 consumer concerns such as depletion of nonrenewable resources, pollution, destruction of
      habitats, and climate change were noted as factors in the marketing environment. Plus, it is in the nature of
      Marketing 3.0&#x2019;s humanity-centric consumers to expect and even demand ecological sustainability from the
      companies we patronize. As collaborative partners cocreating the value we buy, we don&#x2019;t want our
      &#x201C;business partners&#x201D; to be actively harming us or jeopardizing our children&#x2019;s future. For
      these consumers, ecological sustainability is a competitive advantage. <strong>Green marketing</strong> has
      emerged in response&#x2014;an approach characterized by practices that minimize the impacts of production
      processes, packaging, and marketing communications.</p>



    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.2.1">Greening the Four Ps</h2>
    <p class="tx">Green marketing impacts all four of the marketing mix&#x2019;s four Ps:</p>

    <a id="p335"></a>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl"><em>Product: </em>Every manufacturing step offers an opportunity for a company to make green
        choices, from sustainably sourcing its raw materials to how its products are packaged. CSR can be seen as part
        of the product concept that adds value through meeting consumers&#x2019; desire to buy from companies that
        prioritize sustainability. </li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Place: </em>Green marketers must consider the impact of supply chain logistics that get raw
        materials, components, and finished products to consumers. The increased speed of transportation has made
        distribution easier anywhere in the world&#x2014;if you are willing to ignore the carbon footprint of all that
        shipping. Distributed manufacturing offers a green solution, such as using 3-D printing that allows products to
        be manufactured close to final customers (Meyerson, 2015).</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Price:</em> Products with the feature of &#x201C;being green&#x201D; are generally expected to
        be more expensive than conventional offerings&#x2014;but worth it for the planet&#x2019;s sake. However,
        consumer demand for green products proved relatively elastic in the economic downturn of 2008. These factors
        affect pricing decisions for green offerings (Clifford &amp; Martin, 2011).</li>
      <li class="bl"><em>Promotion:</em> Consumers are becoming more skeptical of advertising claims of social
        responsibility (Huffman, 2015). Green offerings bring their ecological bona fides to the brand
        narrative&#x2014;if in fact the product and the company that stands behind it are&#xA0;green.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">Ethically, green marketing is impossible unless the company is green in its behaviors. A
      company&#x2019;s purchasing, production processes, packaging, and marketing communications must all be
      authentically oriented toward ecological sustainability. Let us consider each in turn.</p>


    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Green companies&#x2019; purchasing of raw materials and component parts should be ecologically
        neutral or even benefit producing, as when those purchases reward sustainable agricultural practices. Production
        processes can be &#x201C;greened,&#x201D; as when Nike switched to DyeCoo technology that eliminates the use of
        water in the dyeing process (Nike, 2016).</li>
      <li class="bl">Packaging for shipment has come under fire for creating a growing stream of waste as online
        shopping has grown. E-commerce grew by 25% in 2016, according to NBC News. As consumers receive products
        directly, apartment buildings and homes now generate more waste than retail and grocery stores (Sottile &amp;
        Kent, 2017). Companies have responded with innovative solutions, like Dell Computer&#x2019;s use of agricultural
        waste (such as wheat chaff) injected with mushroom spores. The final product looks and acts like Styrofoam but
        is organic, is biodegradable, and can be used as compost or mulch (Dell, 2016). </li>
      <li class="bl">The greening of marketing communications is most obvious in the shift to online channels and the
        more targeted use of direct mail, which reduces paper consumption. The environmental impact of printed
        communications can be reduced through use of sustainably harvested or recycled paper and printing with soy-based
        ink. Online channels would seem to be free of effects on the environment, but are they really? Media is the
        fifth largest industry in the United States, and with its growth comes attention to the carbon footprint of
        server farms, networks, computers, and mobile devices (Ottman &amp; Mallen, 2014). </li>
    </ul>

      <p class="photo-caption">After losing about 8% of consumers because of negative perceptions, Walmart introduced
        environmentally friendly products, required suppliers to use more efficient packaging, and improved its
        fuel-efficiency processes and waste management.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">Before we leave the topic of green business practices, one emerging business model deserves a closer
      look: the sharing economy model used by companies like Airbnb, Uber, and Turo. By shifting from production of new
      assets to putting customers&#x2019; underutilized assets to work, these companies help the environment. The
      marketplace produces fewer goods while maintaining access to a broad variety of goods and services. Measuring
      carbon emissions, home sharing is 66% more effective than hotels. Car-sharing participants reduce their individual
      emissions by 40% (Scorpio, 2012). The sharing economy model exemplifies the Marketing 3.0 emphasis of cocreation
      of value.</p>



    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.2.2">Issues and Concerns</h2>
    <p class="tx">Overall, green marketing is in harmony with the values of Marketing 3.0&#x2019;s humanity-centric
      consumers. However, companies that want to operate with ecological sustainability must confront several issues.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">There is a great deal of confusion among consumers about sustainability practices. If you have ever
      stood in front of a display of egg cartons at the grocery story, wondering about the relative merits of cage-free,
      free-range, free-roaming, or free-farmed eggs, you have likely experienced this confusion. Eggs can also vary by
      type of feed and use of antibiotics and hormones. In fact, eggs have more eco-labels than any other product,
      according to Consumers Union, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group (Atkinson, 2014). It is this profusion of labels
      that deepens consumer confusion.</p>

   

    <p class="tx">Eggs are just one example of a significant issue facing marketers: the lack of a universally
      understood and respected standard to which the term &#x201C;green&#x201D; can be held. Multiple standards for
      certification and eco-labeling exist, some administered at the federal level and others by nongovernmental
      entities. In a study reported in the <em>Journal of Advertising</em>, researchers Lucy Atkinson and Sonny
      Rosenthal found that consumers prefer detailed labels that contain information about the eco-claims being made
      over simple icons or graphics that suggest eco-friendly qualities. Their study also tested whether the source of
      an eco-label&#x2014;from a government agency or from a corporation&#x2014;affected consumers&#x2019; evaluations.
      They found that while consumers appreciated corporate interest in green practices, they were more likely to trust
      government labels. Atkinson (2014) posited that the advertising industry could be part of an industry movement to
      establish consistency and transparency in labeling.</p>

    <p class="tx">Green marketing can create competitive differentiation for a brand. But if that marketing is not held
      to the standards set by the FTC, a company may be engaging in <strong>greenwashing</strong>, a term for deceptive
      marketing communications that promote a perception that a company&#x2019;s policies or products are
      environmentally friendly when that is not actually the case. If consumers believe that a company is greenwashing,
      that perception can damage the brand&#x2019;s reputation whether or not greenwashing is actually taking place.
      Thus, it is important to hold all marketing to a high ethical standard. </p>

    <p class="tx">In 2012 the FTC issued revised Green Guides to help marketers avoid making green marketing claims that
      are unfair or deceptive. The Green Guides include sections on the principles of ecological benefit claims, as well
      as guidance on specific claims, such as &#x201C;nontoxic&#x201D; and &#x201C;recyclable,&#x201D; plus use of
      carbon offsets, green certifications and seals, and renewable energy and renewable materials claims. Marketers
      should use caution when making green marketing claims, since misleading or overstated claims can lead to
      regulatory or civil challenges (Federal Trade Commission, 2018) and, of course, making such claims is unethical.
    </p>

    <a id="p337"></a>
    <p class="tx">Exaggerated claims and false claims are two kinds of ethical lapses related to greenwashing.
      Volkswagen portrayed itself as an environmental steward producing automobiles at the leading edge of the clean
      energy revolution, until it was discovered to have installed software designed to trick emissions tests on 11
      million cars with supposedly clean diesel engines. Other carmakers have sinned by exaggeration as well: In 2014
      Kia and Hyundai paid $300 million in fines after overstating the gas mileage for 1.2 million vehicles (Gelles,
      2015). </p>

    <p class="tx">Examples of false claims are rarer, thankfully. And yet when a claim of responsibility to the planet
      is baldly better for the company than the consumer, it creates a perception of greenwashing that can damage a
      brand&#x2014;and a whole industry. Hotels have begun encouraging guests to support the environment by shutting off
      lights and reusing towels, but these claims are increasingly recognized as self-serving, since they also reduce
      operating costs
      (McMurray, 2015). </p>

    <p class="tx">Underwriters Laboratory (UL) maintains a list of &#x201C;deadly sins of greenwashing&#x201D; which
      marketers would do well to follow. For the list, follow the link in <em>Field Trip 10.5</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.2.3">Green Marketing Is Growing</h2>
    <p class="tx">As has been shown, the implications of green marketing reach into every corner of a business, from
      modifying the four Ps to choosing marketing communication practices that do not take advantage of consumer
      confusion. Marketers must steer clear of greenwashing to establish authentically green value propositions and thus
      meet Marketing 3.0 consumers&#x2019; desire to do business with companies that respect the triple bottom line of
      financial, social, and environmental sustainability.</p>

      <p class="credit">Associated Press</p>
      <p class="photo-caption">All Subaru production plants commit to zero-landfill manufacturing, and its Indiana
        automobile production plant is the only such facility in the United States to be designated a wildlife habitat
        by the NWF, according to the company&#x2019;s media center.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tx">An excellent example of authentically green marketing comes from Japanese automaker Subaru. In 2016
      and again in 2017, the automaker teamed up with the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) to combat decline of
      natural habitats in a partnership branded Subaru Loves the Earth. Following guidelines from the NWF, Subaru
      created certified wildlife habitats on the grounds of over 400 schools and supported hands-on educational programs
      to connect young people with nature. Subaru donated gardening supplies and paired Subaru dealerships with schools
      in their areas to provide the water, nutrients, and care the wildlife habitats need to thrive. Participating
      schools were encouraged to share photos and stories in their social streams. The Subaru Loves the Earth initiative
      was humanity-centric, ecologically beneficial, and a good fit between the company&#x2019;s value chain and its
      core customers&#x2019; values (Subaru U.S. Media Center, 2017).</p>


    <p class="tx">Every company should at least evaluate the possibility of integrating ecologically sound practices
      into its business strategy. Green marketing is not a cure-all for boosting sales, and it can be more difficult to
      sustain during times of economic hardship for consumers, but companies that do adopt this approach gain an
      important point of competitive differentiation. These companies should make their credibility apparent by
      displaying their proof of meeting recognized standards of green performance. Reporting standards, certifications,
      and eco-labels are useful green marketing tools (Aulakh, 2012).</p>


    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider </strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Do you research a company&#x2019;s green status before purchasing? Does that behavior change when
        you are purchasing in a local store versus purchasing online? Does it make a difference what kind of products
        you are thinking about? For example, do you strive for sustainability when it is something you purchase and
        consume frequently, like household products, but less when thinking about purchases that you make only rarely,
        like furniture or a car?</p>
    </div>



    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec10.3">10.3&#x2002;Responsibility to the Marketing Profession</h1>

    <p class="tx">When you accept a position as a marketer, whether with a small start-up company or an established
      global brand, you commit to bring honor to the house. Your first step toward responsibility to the marketing field
      should be to join professional associations, industry trade groups, and local business organizations. These
      groups&#x2019; members will continue your education in best practices and emerging issues.</p>

    <p class="tx">The chief organization to which marketers in the United States belong is the American Marketing
      Association (AMA). This group&#x2019;s roots stretch back to the early 1900s in marketing education as well as
      practice. Today the AMA serves as a conduit for knowledge sharing, provides resources and professional development
      opportunities, and promotes thought leadership to help marketers deepen their expertise and enhance their careers.

    <a id="p339"></a>
    <p class="tx">After joining organizations such as the AMA, make time to be a full participant. When you attend
      meetings, pay attention to presentations; the information you take in will be fresher than anything you find in
      books or periodicals. Ask for copies of handouts and slide decks if not provided. Ask questions of the presenter.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Make use of networking time during association meetings to develop relationships with colleagues and
      potential mentors. Share what you&#x2019;re working on with your peers, within the bounds of confidentiality.
      Volunteer for service roles, choosing project work or organizational leadership, depending on your time and
      talents. The time you invest will prepare you for success.</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.3.1">Know and Abide by Applicable Laws and Regulations </h2>
    <p class="tx">In Chapter 8 you learned that laws and regulations crafted to protect companies, consumers, and
      society require businesses to operate in specific ways. It is incumbent on marketers to be familiar with the
      regulations affecting the general practice of marketing and those specific to certain industries. Intellectual
      property and copyright laws apply to everyone, including all marketing practitioners in all industries. Airlines,
      telecommunications, utilities, financial services, and health care are among the industries in which marketers
      must know and abide by additional applicable laws and regulations.</p>

    <p class="tx">For example, financial institutions are subject to certain requirements, restrictions, and guidelines
      designed to maintain the integrity of the financial system. Regulatory authorities include the U.S. Securities and
      Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the National
      Credit Union Administration. In financial services, regulations will always have an impact on the marketing
      department, because changes trigger a need to communicate with clients of the institution.</p>

    <a id="p340"></a>
    <p class="tx">In health care, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) addressed many
      issues, including the need to ensure the security and privacy of health data. The HIPAA Privacy Rule defines how
      health care providers and insurers can use individually identifiable health information (termed Personal Health
      Information, or PHI). Data-driven marketing techniques must comply with HIPAA limits designed to minimize the
      chance for inappropriate disclosure of PHI (What Is HIPPA, 2012).</p>

    <p class="tx">With regulation comes compliance; financial service marketers must work closely with their compliance
      officers to ensure that all efforts are &#x201C;up to code.&#x201D; Health care marketers must be knowledgeable
      about the many fine points of HIPAA in order to design marketing strategies that abide by the applicable laws and
      regulations.</p>



    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.3.2">Practice Within Ethical Boundaries</h2>
    <p class="tx">Most marketing tactics are not constrained or prohibited by existing laws and regulations. But there
      is still a guideline with which marketers&#x2019; behavior must comply: the profession&#x2019;s own ethical
      boundaries, touched on earlier in the discussion of ethical marketing.</p>

    <p class="tx">Customers will resist doing business with a company that behaves unethically. An important marketing
      practice designed to respect ethical boundaries is <strong>permission marketing</strong>, a concept popularized by
      Seth Godin in his 1999 book <em>Permission Marketing: Turning Strangers </em><em>Into Friends, and Friends Into
        Customers</em>. This direct marketing practice arose in response to concerns about unwanted e-mail (spam) and
      other marketing communications. Permission marketing requires obtaining permission from prospective customers
      before directing more marketing efforts toward them. Godin&#x2019;s (1999) insight was that true one-to-one
      relationships are built on an explicit agreement between seller and buyer. In an age of data-driven marketing
      communications, tracking the <strong>opt-in</strong> or <strong>opt-out</strong> status for each relationship is
      not difficult&#x2014;and absolutely required for marketing within ethical boundaries.</p>

    <p class="tx">One of the overriding themes in discussions of ethical business practices is the issue of
      <strong>transparency</strong>&#x2014;the use of nondeceptive tactics and the ready disclosure of the motivation
      behind observable action. Specifically, do recipients of promotional messages know when a pitch is being made? The
      answer was easy in traditional marketing communications, where a logo or the words &#x201C;brought to you
      by&#x201D; conveyed all the information that was needed about who was selling what. Advertisers&#x2019; defense
      was that consumers were intelligent and could identify commercial messages and interpret them as such. In an era
      in which paid brand ambassadors and product placements blur the boundaries of commercial pitches, the
      &#x201C;intelligent consumer&#x201D; defense starts to break down. Permission marketing is one strategy by which
      transparency is reintroduced.</p>

    <p class="tx">But transparency is more than avoidance of deception. <em>Transparent</em> literally means
      &#x201C;what is beyond or behind can be distinctly seen.&#x201D; In this sense transparency goes hand in hand with
      authenticity. Companies are learning not to try to convince consumers they are anything other than what they truly
      are, in terms of their business model, marketing messages, and ethical behavior. A case in point:
      McDonald&#x2019;s Canada developed its &#x201C;Our food. Your questions&#x201D; campaign to counter misinformation
      and customer concerns about ingredients in its food. The campaign gave customers an opportunity to ask
      anything&#x2014;and McDonald&#x2019;s a chance to educate consumers and stand by its word. The campaign launched
      in 2014 and by July 2016 had attracted over 42,000 questions and 3.8 million visitors to the campaign&#x2019;s FAQ
      website (Milbrath, 2016). </p>

    <p class="tx">A &#x201C;fail&#x201D; by Domino&#x2019;s shows that a small error can erode trust. Domino&#x2019;s
      app lets customers track their pizza. But in 2017 one customer got a message that delivery driver
      &#x201C;Melinda&#x201D; would arrive with his pizza. Instead, a man showed up. &#x201C;Ever since then, I knew
      everything they said . . . was made up,&#x201D; Brent Gardiner told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.
      Domino&#x2019;s responded that &#x201C;Tracker has worked as intended for . . . millions of orders. . . .
      Sometimes people make mistakes.&#x201D; Not even a white lie is acceptable to Marketing 3.0 consumers (Bindley,
      2017).</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing tactics will continue to evolve, with norms involving transparency, protecting privacy, and
      ethical organizational behavior evolving in response. Marketing leaders are calling for the industry to take a
      leadership role in establishing those norms (Drumwright &amp; Murphy, 2009). A good place to begin, as you prepare
      to join practitioners in the field of marketing, is with the AMA&#x2019;s Statement of Ethics; follow the link in

    </div>

    <p class="tx">In conclusion, as marketers we each owe our profession our best work. We keep our knowledge and skills
      at their sharpest by actively participating in professional organizations. Marketers must also know and abide by
      applicable laws on the books, as well as the unwritten ethical code emerging from contemporary marketing practice
      that welcomes transparency, rewards relationship building, and condemns greenwashing and other forms of deceptive
      spin.</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Questions to Consider </strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">Who gets to decide what is ethical behavior? Should rank-and-file employees leave such decisions to
        the organization&#x2019;s leaders? Can marketers live by one set of ethical values in their personal life but
        carry out assignments that ignore those values while at work?</p>
    </div>


    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec10.4">10.4&#x2002;Responsibility to Your Organization</h1>

    <p class="tx">When you accept a marketing position, you become ethically bound to serve the public and the marketing
      profession. You also accept an ethical responsibility to your employer. The relationship is not simply economic;
      it is a mutual dependency with impact on both employer and employee. The employer has an obligation to consider
      employees&#x2019; welfare. The employee has a duty to give a full measure of effort in return for a paycheck. In
      addition, employees have an obligation to behave ethically in all transactions with stakeholders&#x2014;coworkers,
      managers, shareholders, and customers.</p>

    <p class="tx">More companies today are making their philosophy and values transparent. The public experiences that
      transparency in mission statements, positioning slogans, and the like. Stakeholders are provided with company
      policies and guidelines designed to help managers deal ethically with questions and issues that arise. These
      guidelines typically cover the company&#x2019;s CSR philosophy plus policies regarding customer service, supply
      chain relations, and issues relating to the marketing mix such as fair pricing, safe product development, and
      truth in advertising. Organizations bear the responsibility to ensure that such policies are credible,
      sustainable, meaningful, and prudent (i.e., will not jeopardize profitability or the interests of shareholders.)
      Prospective employees increasingly say they want to work in organizations that share their philosophies and values
      (Balmer, Reyser, &amp; Powell, 2011). Transparency regarding philosophy and social responsibility policies helps
      employers and employees find the right fit.</p>



    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.4.1">Responsibility to the Brand</h2>
    <p class="tx">Branding as a marketing technique is intended to attract and retain customer relationships. Marketing
      3.0 consumers are looking for ethical, customer-oriented brands. A brand&#x2019;s narrative emerges from public
      perceptions of the brand&#x2019;s persona. Whether that story is positive or negative reflects marketers&#x2019;
      performance in living up to the image they&#x2019;ve created. Patagonia is one brand that has earned a reputation
      for social responsibility. Others include Stonyfield Farm (organic dairy products), Tom&#x2019;s of Maine
      (personal care), the Body Shop (personal care), and Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s (ice cream), among others (Balmer et
      al., 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">No organization can maintain an ethical reputation for its brand when its rhetoric is divorced from
      reality. Attempts to do so have brought trouble to the likes of Toyota, BP, and Wells Fargo. </p>

        to customers. Therefore, brands must prepare to respond to unfortunate events. </p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.4.2">Responsibility to Channel Partners</h2>
    <p class="tx">An expectation of ethical behavior is part of the relationship among partners in organizations&#x2019;
      supply chains. A few negative events can undo the cumulative effect of many positive activities. Factors most
      often cited in research about channel partner relationships are conflict, opportunism, and unfairness (Samaha,
      Palmatier, &amp; Dant, 2011). Managers should take a proactive approach&#x2014;for example, developing training
      for channel partners in the importance of ethical behavior and enforcing contracts designed to mitigate the
      potential for conflict and opportunism.</p>

    <p class="tx">Consider the fictionalized example of a SkyView Foods marketing analyst named Eric. He was tasked with
      improving the software that aggregated individual store sales in the 28-store grocery chain. The aggregate sales
      data reports were used to claim promotional reimbursement from a manufacturer in a trade promotion. The amount of
      each reimbursement check was based on the quantity of product retailers sold to consumers, rather than the
      quantity purchased from the manufacturer. Eric&#x2019;s department submitted sales reports to claim the
      reimbursement, which the manufacturer checked for accuracy, duplication, eligibility, pricing, and customer
      returns. Once the claims were reviewed, payment was made to SkyView Foods.</p>

    <p class="tx">The new software Eric implemented automated the sales reports that were previously produced by an
      accounting clerk. Eric&#x2019;s boss came to him with a command to revise the new software so that &#x201C;counts
      could be modified.&#x201D; When Eric probed about what sort of modifications could be needed, he learned that the
      company had been fudging the counts of products purchased to increase reimbursements from manufacturers.
      Eric&#x2019;s colleagues encouraged him to go along with the deception, citing better prices for customers as a
      result. Eric was still pondering his dilemma when the manufacturer discovered the discrepancy in past reports.
      Eric did a quick online search and learned that when similar deceptions were uncovered, other retailers had been
      required to pay fines. In one such account, he learned that five executives&#x2014;including the one who blew the
      whistle on the deception&#x2014;lost their jobs (Castleberry, 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">Eric&#x2019;s situation highlights the difficulty for an employee when channel partner relationships
      veer toward the unethical. In this case, opportunism spelled real potential risk for Eric&#x2019;s
      employer&#x2014;and possibly for its employees as well.</p>


    <a id="p344"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.4.3">Responsibility for Value Creation</h2>
    <p class="tx">What&#x2019;s <em>your</em> ROI? In other words, what return are you generating on the investment your
      company has made in you? You are responsible for creating value for your employer. If you are not focused on that
      goal, you are slighting one of the chief responsibilities incumbent on an employee. (This applies not just in the
      marketing field, but in any position.) Generating value is your obligation&#x2014;and your job security, to some
      extent.</p>

    <p class="tx">What defines a value-creating employee? Some of the attributes are tactical, having to do with
      handling responsibilities efficiently and effectively. A value-creating employee completes assigned tasks without
      waste and with positive outcomes.</p>

    <p class="tx">Some of the attributes of a value-creating employee are strategic, having to do with seeing the big
      picture and envisioning where effort would add value. Do you bring a problem-solving mind-set to your role in your
      employer company? The best problem solvers are systems thinkers who view a &#x201C;problem&#x201D; as an
      interdependent part of an overall system. Rather than react to a specific part (problem), systems thinkers
      envision how the outcomes or events triggered by a proposed solution will potentially contribute to the whole.
      Because of their attention to the whole, systems thinkers are better at contributing solutions that improve
      operations without bringing unintended consequences.</p>

    <p class="tx">Systems thinkers create value. If your current role does not allow you to bring a problem-solving
      mind-set, what aspect of your work life could you use to demonstrate those capabilities and show your potential to
      generate added value beyond the role you were hired to fill?</p>

    <p class="tx">The bottom line is this: Employees who are not generating value are generating reasons for
      redefinition of their job descriptions. If you&#x2019;re not creating value in your current role, you&#x2019;d
      better have your resume up-to-date. Where would you like to be employed instead? Envision the type of company and
      position in which you will be able to generate a positive ROI for your next employer.</p>

    <p class="tx">This discussion of the ethical requirements of employees toward their employers has covered
      responsibility to the brand, to the company&#x2019;s channel partners, and to value creation at the level of
      individual effort. At every level in an organization, it is important for individuals to walk the talk supporting
      relationships among channel partners and between the brand and its public.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="h1" id="sec10.5">10.5&#x2002;Responsibility to Yourself</h1>

    <p class="tx">The September 1997 issue of <em>Fast Company</em> magazine carried an article titled &#x201C;The Brand
      Called You&#x201D; authored by business management guru Tom Peters. The essay called for workers to recognize
      their role as &#x201C;head marketer for the brand called YOU.&#x201D; Appearing as the first dot-com boom was
      still on the rise, the article captured much about a time when the world of work was rapidly being reinvented. At
      one end of the spectrum, large companies were growing even larger through mergers and acquisitions. At the other
      end, dot-com start-ups were grabbing attention and unprecedented investor dollars. The Internet had delivered the
      potential for an economy based on a free-agent workforce. Peters tapped a nerve.</p>



    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.5.1">The Free Agent Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="tx">&#x201C;Everyone has a chance to be a brand worthy of remark,&#x201D; Peters (2007, para. 10)
      declared. Then he proceeded to apply the principles of positioning to the problem of career success. Peters
      observed that when anyone can have a consumer presence and a communication channel, the people who succeed will be
      those who have built a trusted brand name. Peters spelled out the need for positioning &#x201C;Brand You&#x201D;
      on points of competitive differentiation. He asked individuals to take the challenge marketers put brands through:
      Answer the question &#x201C;What is it that my product or service does that makes it different?&#x201D; in 15
      words or less. What&#x2019;s the customer value equation offered by &#x201C;Brand You&#x201D;? Delivering work
      reliably on time, giving excellent service to internal and external customers, and meeting allotted budgets are
      all features with benefits.</p>

    <p class="tx">But Peters pressed his readers to go a step further: to ask what you do that adds measurable,
      distinctive value. What have you accomplished that you can shamelessly brag about? What do you want to be known
      for?</p>

    <p class="tx">As a student of marketing, it should be clear to you that these questions aren&#x2019;t
      rhetorical&#x2014;they&#x2019;re the tools of the trade marketers use to find a unique value proposition on which
      to position a brand.</p>

    <p class="tx">Peters identified a key shift in the 1990s world of work: the emergence of what he termed
      &#x201C;Project World.&#x201D; In Project World, careers are not a linear climb up a corporate ladder. Instead,
      careers are constructed from a stream of steadily more interesting, challenging, influential projects. Loyalty in
      Project World is not given blindly to a company&#x2014;it belongs to colleagues, teams, projects, customers, and
      self. &#x201C;A career is a portfolio of projects that teach you new skills, gain you new expertise, develop new
      capabilities, grow your colleague set, and consistently reinvent you as a brand,&#x201D; Peters (2007, para. 20)
      wrote. He concluded his landmark article with a call to define success as doing what you love, as a result of job
      and project opportunities that allow one to be a great colleague, visionary, business strategist, and creator of
      value (Peters, 2007).</p>

    <p class="tx">Since Peters published &#x201C;The Brand Called You,&#x201D; the sheer proliferation of messages and
      message channels has made standing out as an individual more doable&#x2014;and, paradoxically, more difficult. The
      takeaway from Peters&#x2019;s lesson in applying branding to individual career development is simple: Focus on
      becoming the best at what you do.</p>

    <a id="p346"></a>
    <p class="tx">Did &#x201C;Project World&#x201D; emerge as Peters projected it would? Pretty much, although it earned
      a different name&#x2014;the &#x201C;Gig Economy.&#x201D; A 2017 study found that 36% of the U.S. workforce were
      freelancers, with freelancing expected to surpass traditional employment by 2027. Millennials are leading the way
      in this trend, the study found: Forty-seven percent of millennial workers were freelancing, more than any previous
      generation (Edelman Intelligence, 2017).</p>

    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.5.2">Commit to Your Success</h2>
    <p class="tx">Will you commit to developing Brand You as head marketer for your personal brand or follow a more
      traditional approach to your career design? Either way, certain basic responsibilities to yourself apply. You must
      commit to doing original work; to filling the gaps in your skills, knowledge, and abilities; and to avoiding
      inappropriate self-promotion.</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Do original work: </em>As a student, you have no doubt been warned about the perils of plagiarism.
      All laws concerning the originality of ideas apply to you whether you are a student, employee, free agent, or
      entrepreneur. <strong>Intellectual property</strong> consists of the output of the minds of individuals that has
      commercial value, including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works. Because
      it is property, it can be kept or sold. Others can be prevented from altering it or selling it for their profit.
      Copyright law exists to protect intellectual property and covers both published and unpublished work. The minimum
      requirements for copyright law to apply are that the work must be original, have exhibited some minimal level of
      creativity, and be in a fixed form of expression. Fine points of the law cover <strong>fair use</strong> and
      <strong>parody</strong>, two exceptions that allow a certain degree of leeway in the use of others&#x2019;
      intellectual property. The website <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://www.copyright.gov">http://www.copyright.gov</a> provides a wealth of information on applicable U.S.
      law.</p>

    <p class="tx">In a culture that has grown increasingly accepting of the <strong>mashup</strong>&#x2014;a term that
      comes from the hip-hop music practice of mixing two or more songs&#x2014;it is easy to forget that a chain of
      responsibility to the original creators exists with each bit and byte appropriated for new creative work. As a
      marketer, you will likely face frequent temptation to build on or borrow from inspirations in popular culture
      around you. Commit to working within the bounds of the law&#x2014;and showcasing your own original talent.</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Fill your skills gaps: </em>When you step into a position in a marketing department, your
      education and previous work and life experience will have led to mastery of a set of skills. But will that include
      everything your new position requires? Likely not. Given the rapid pace of evolution in marketing, especially in
      digital channels, knowledge and skills become outdated quickly. Don&#x2019;t be discouraged by what you
      don&#x2019;t know; your ability to learn is more important to an employer than mastery of outdated skill sets.</p>

    <p class="tx">Because marketing plays a significant role in both the costs and the sales of a business, familiarity
      with basic accounting is recommended for marketers. You also need enough knowledge of math concepts such as ratios
      to understand what the gauges on a marketing dashboard indicate or to perform a breakeven analysis. Good written
      and verbal communication skills are also a must in business, even for people in technical and/or analytical roles.
      Ability to write clearly and concisely is important.</p>

    <p class="tx">If your education has not exposed you to sociology, psychology, or anthropology, you are likely to
      find yourself in a customer-oriented company without sufficient understanding of human behavior. If you have not
      studied engineering or biological sciences, you may be missing the systems thinking or scientific knowledge that
      would make you more valuable to your employer. Commit to lifelong learning, both through study and
      experimentation. Mark Brown, SEO/content strategist at Wunderman Memphis, a digital marketing agency, says:</p>

    <p class="ext">You can dive right into social media management and website building. It costs no money to create a
      Facebook page, and there are many options available to build free websites. Whether you&#x2019;re sharing your
      favorite memes or writing articles about your favorite video games, you&#x2019;ll get exposure to tracking traffic
      and engagement metrics, creating content, and basic website architecture. These skills, as well as your initiative
      and curiosity, will be received positively by hiring managers. (M. Brown, author interview, December 8, 2017)</p>

    <p class="tx"><em>Avoid inappropriate self-promotion:</em> Whether or not you wholeheartedly adopt the Brand You
      philosophy, develop your instinct for appropriate self-promotion. It has never been easier to build Brand You, but
      it has also never been easier to destroy your brand.</p>

    <p class="tx">Seek and accept assignments that allow you to build skills and showcase them. That might mean
      volunteering for an extra project or teaching a class, writing for the company newsletter or local paper, or
      offering to give presentations at workshops and conferences. The visibility will build Brand You&#x2014;if you
      deliver substance and avoid shameless self-promotion.</p>

    <p class="tx">Also use social media to raise your visibility&#x2014;but be sure you have something to say. Quality
      rules over quantity in the busy world of social networks. Other rules of appropriate self-promotion include the
      following.</p>


    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Keep your credentials visible&#x2014;but never fake or exaggerate them.</li>
      <li class="bl">Develop an area of expertise and become your company&#x2019;s &#x201C;go-to&#x201D; person on that
        topic&#x2014;even if it&#x2019;s just how to produce better PowerPoint presentations.</li>
      <li class="bl">Once you&#x2019;ve built that area of expertise, share it freely. Give advice and offer opinions.
        (But acknowledge the expertise of others just as freely.)</li>
      <li class="bl">In social media, create conversation. Ask questions, post tips, and let building Brand You follow
        naturally.</li>
      <li class="bl">Divide your time responsibly. Make sure more of your time is spent on value creation for your team
        than for Brand You. Putting a little of your work time into being visible is good for all, but too much is not.
        Some say an 80/20 split is about right (Elmer,&#xA0;2011).</li>
    </ul>

    <a id="p348"></a>
    <p class="tx">Bottom line: Bragging will get Brand You nowhere. Becoming the best at what you do will.</p>

    <p class="tx">While not everyone agrees today about the enduring applicability of Peters&#x2019;s free agent
      philosophy, it has come to characterize the workplace experience of many. Peters&#x2019;s Project World describes
      where many marketers work today. In Project World, individuals must take responsibility for the originality of the
      work they produce, the development of their skills and knowledge base to meet evolving demands, and the style with
      which they pursue self-promotion.</p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing positions can take you in several different directions. If you are by nature an analytic

    <p class="tx">Marketing is such an important business function across such a broad spectrum of organizations that it
      would be easier to answer &#x201C;where <em>isn&#x2019;t</em> there opportunity?&#x201D; than to specify where
      opportunity exists. Marketers work in three areas:</p>


    <ol class="nl">
      <li class="nl">as entrepreneurs, marketing the organizations they lead</li>
      <li class="nl">in organizations with marketing departments</li>
      <li class="nl">in agencies that provide specialized services to organizations</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tx">The nature of work life is somewhat different in each of these career paths. Entrepreneurship gives
      some people their first taste of marketing work. Some discover marketing in their DNA and go on to make that
      aspect of starting and running a business the focus of their careers. The case study in this chapter follows an
      entrepreneur who brought to life his concept&#x2014;connecting people to cultural projects for financial support.
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Marketing departments within organizations, including for-profit companies, social enterprises,
      nonprofit groups, and government agencies, produce a significant portion of marketing jobs.</p>

    <p class="tx">Agencies that provide specialized services such as advertising, marketing communications, event
      management, social media management, and web content fill out the opportunities for employment in the marketing
      field.</p>

    <p class="tx">Within organizations there are typically multiple levels, including executives, managers, and
      specialists. In companies and agencies, account executives often serve as liaisons between members of teams
      serving specific accounts. All three types of workplaces (start-up, corporate, or agency) offer careers in
      marketing. Individuals could choose to specialize in one sector or move among them for a more varied career
      experience.</p>

    <p class="tx">As the business world adapts to the expectations of the emerging Marketing 3.0 era, working
      relationships, job roles and titles, and everything else is undergoing a process of reinvention. Do not expect
      yesterday&#x2019;s functional structures to be relevant in tomorrow&#x2019;s workplace. As you look for a job in
      the marketing field, you will need to seek the latest information about job roles and the skills and abilities
      they require.</p>


    <a id="p350"></a>
    <h2 class="h2" id="sec10.6.2">Your Career in a Marketing 3.0 World</h2>
    <p class="tx">Consider the forces identified with Marketing 3.0: consumers&#x2019; demand for participation,
      increasing global opportunity and the resulting need for increased social responsibility, and an increasingly
      creative, connected society able to focus on higher meaning. What do these forces spell for careers in marketing?
    </p>

    <p class="tx">Traditional marketers relied on four skill areas: personal selling, advertising communications, sales
      promotion, and marketing research (Kotler, 2005). As data mining, CRM, experiential marketing, and online media
      have joined the mix, a whole new set of skills will be needed. Consider the following media reports about changing
      expectations.</p>

    <p class="tx">A gap is emerging between worker skills and the demands of new jobs that require substantial
      quantitative, mathematical, and technical skills. Today&#x2019;s behavioral targeting techniques put the emphasis
      on generating many ideas and testing them for consumer appeal. Agencies are now hiring &#x201C;number
      crunchers&#x201D; to perform quantitative analysis and produce data visualizations that reveal the meaning behind
      the numbers. Skills like interactive design, social media, and coding languages are in demand. The most attractive
      candidate will bring a talent for strategic insight in addition to creative and technical skills (Vega, 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">The new advertising agency organization will transition its workers from generalists to specialists in
      one of four specialties: strategists, creators, connectors, and catalysts. Old titles like vice president or
      account supervisor will go away, possibly to be replaced with titles that specify job type followed by
      &#x201C;senior&#x201D; or &#x201C;associate&#x201D; to designate levels of accountability. Even the workplace will
      be reimagined to reflect the process of managing campaigns that combine paid, earned, owned, and shared media
      channels (Elliott, 2011c).</p>

    <p class="tx">The public relations industry is undergoing a self-initiated makeover, recognizing that the profound
      changes in the earned media channel call for a new definition of its work. New media have made it easier for
      consumers to learn about corporate blunders; public relations today is more about facilitating an ongoing
      conversation than influencing what the public believes. The public relations field encourages practitioners to
      take actions that counter a negative view of public relations as &#x201C;spin,&#x201D; such as joining its
      professional association and adhering to its code of ethics and standards of practice (Elliott, 2011f).</p>

    <p class="tx">Employers today seek people who can create value on the job that technology cannot. The people who
      succeed will be those who can innovate, adapt, and reinvent their jobs as business practices evolve.</p>

    <p class="tx">The many different marketing career paths have one thing in common: All offer the ability to help an
      organization succeed. Whether you find your niche in entrepreneurship, organizational work, or a role in a
      service-providing agency, you will be contributing to building a brand, improving product and service offerings,
      and enhancing customer loyalty. In the meantime, develop your marketing skills. These will help you sell yourself
      to potential employers.</p>

    <p class="tx">In 1968 the Virginia Slims cigarette brand was introduced to young professional women with the slogan
      &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve come a long way, baby.&#x201D; At this point in your study of marketing, you recognize not
      just the historical era in marketing that the campaign belongs to, but also the ethical issues presented by that
      product and promotional strategy. You&#x2019;ve come a long way, baby!</p>

    <p class="tx">You&#x2019;ve developed an appreciation of the transformation in marketing practice now under way. You
      are prepared to meet the demands of communicating with consumers who are more media-savvy and more empowered than
      ever before. You can distinguish between corporate behavior that adds value to the triple bottom line of
      &#x201C;people, planet, and profits&#x201D; and behavior that does not. You are prepared to begin the search for a
      fulfilling role in the economy in a company you believe in or to pursue more education that will lead to a
      fulfilling role. This demand for connection between employees&#x2019; and employers&#x2019; value systems is
      itself a paradigm shift, one more added to the many that are changing the practice of marketing.</p>

    <p class="tx">This course has introduced you to concepts and processes in the first two chapters, laying a
      foundation for subsequent exploration of aspects that are under marketers&#x2019; control&#x2014;for example, the
      marketing mix covered in Chapters 4 through 6.</p>

    <p class="tx">In Chapters 7 and 8 you were called on to contemplate the uncontrollable factors marketers face: the
      nature of customers; their purchasing behavior, emotions, and motivations; and marketers&#x2019; responses to
      customer behavior, including the STP approach and increasing emphasis on making customers true collaborators in
      creating the value they seek. You&#x2019;ve learned about sociocultural, technological, ecological, economic,
      political, and legal forces in the marketing environment, at home, and around the globe.</p>

    <a id="p352"></a>
    <p class="tx">The final two chapters have drawn you deeper into management of the marketing process and hopefully
      heightened your awareness of the responsibility you bear to the public, your profession and employer, and your own
      future when you take a position in the marketing&#xA0;field.</p>

    <p class="tx">This course has been designed to stimulate your enthusiasm for more learning about the business of
      marketing. If the workplace rather than course work is in your future, the contemporary examples in this course
      (designed to connect theory to current practice) should help you hit the ground running. Either way, your mastery
      of the basic principles of marketing will help you succeed.</p>


    <h2 class="Case-Study h2" id="ch10casestudy"><strong>Case Study: </strong><em>Power2give</em></h2>

    <p class="tx">The entrepreneurial approach that founder Scott Provancher brought to developing power2give for his
      employer, the Arts and Science Council (ASC) of Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina, presents an example of
      responsible marketing that takes into account a desire to serve the public good, the fund-raising profession, an
      employer organization, and a young man&#x2019;s own career.</p>

    <p class="tx">When Provancher, president of the ASC of Charlotte-Mecklenburg, crunched the numbers, he saw
      red&#x2014;red ink. The numbers indicated steeply declining dollars from workplace donations. Like many of its
      peer organizations across the United States, the ASC is an arts agency engaged in grant making, managing public
      arts programs, and providing services to help artists and organizations. The decline in workplace giving triggered
      by the 2008 economic downturn severely affected several major employers in the Charlotte area.</p>

    <p class="tx">As the council&#x2019;s president, ultimate responsibility for donor development lay with Provancher.
      Luckily, he had a bent for entrepreneurial thinking. Turning the funding crisis into an opportunity for
      innovation, he developed a new product that would help not only the organization he led but also its peers around
      the country and the public audiences they ultimately serve. He created power2give.</p>

    <p class="tx">Power2give is an online cultural marketplace listing projects seeking funding in the arts, sciences,
      and history. The website brings donors and nonprofit organizations together with a simple online interface for
      describing projects, promoting them, and making donating convenient for both giver and receiver.</p>

    <p class="tx">The powerful but simple idea for this online tool was born out of strategic planning by the ASC in
      late 2010. Provancher, 36 at the time, assembled ASC staff members and stakeholders to conduct strategic planning.
      He brought his insights about fund-raising in a Marketing 3.0 world. &#x201C;People expect more emotional
      connection with the organizations they donate to,&#x201D; he recalled saying to his senior staff. &#x201C;We need
      to make $25 donors feel like $25,000 donors&#x201D; (S. Provancher, personal communication, January 2011).
      Provancher sketched out the site concept and conceived the name. The ASC invested in the website&#x2019;s
      development and branding. A year later, the new fund-raising tool was launched. The ASC sought out its peer arts
      councils in other cities, enrolling them in the power2give platform as host organizations who would promote the
      tool to both donors and project organizers in their local communities. </p>

    <a id="p353"></a>
    <p class="tx">Provancher knew he wasn&#x2019;t the first to envision a social media platform model applied to
      funding for cultural projects. Kickstarter (<a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="http://www.kickstarter.com">http://www.kickstarter.com</a>) had been launched in April 2009. But
      Provancher spotted several weaknesses in how Kickstarter could meet the needs of the types of cultural
      organizations the ASC typically funded. Responding to these concerns led to features of power2give that
      differentiate it from Kickstarter, such as tax deductions for donations, an ability to make challenge grants, and
      a gift card program that allows a donor to select a dollar amount while the recipient selects a project to receive
      the funds.</p>

    <p class="tx">For the public, power2give provides an easy way to find out about projects of interest, see the
      progress of fund-raising so far, and use the simple online interface to donate. Donors and other visitors to
      project sites are encouraged to help promote projects through e-mail and their social media channels. </p>

    <p class="tx">Local host organizations enrolled in power2give invest in comarketing to support the fund-raisers who
      post projects on the site, and offer training and support in social media marketing.</p>

    <p class="tx">Provancher fulfilled his responsibility to his employer by focusing on building a sound business model
      for power2give. &#x201C;We envision rolling this out to hundreds of communities,&#x201D; Provancher (personal
      communication) said in January 2011. To succeed, having launched its initial product, the ASC must stay on track
      to develop needed functionality. Power2give&#x2019;s creators must convince enough new communities of the power of
      its fund-raising model to eventually recoup the costs of start-up. Provancher&#x2019;s responsibility to the ASC
      requires him to lead power2give&#x2019;s development so that it contributes to the ASC&#x2019;s mission.</p>

    <p class="tx">Provancher&#x2019;s service to the public, the fund-raising profession, and the ASC also serves his
      own career development&#x2014;which has taken an unusual path. Trained as a classical percussionist, he
      didn&#x2019;t realize marketing was in his DNA until his work in fund-raising for orchestras and subsequently the
      ASC brought the realization that &#x201C;marketing is like getting a piece ready for performance. The plan is just
      notes on a page. Marketing is constantly testing, changing, and adapting the piece to appeal to an
      audience&#x201D; (S. Provancher, personal communication, January 2011). He then developed his Brand You with a
      &#x201C;layman&#x2019;s MBA&#x201D; by taking business courses and reading books and publications such as the
      <em>Harvard Business Review</em>. </p>

    <p class="tx">When interviewed in 2011, Provancher was grateful to the ASC for the opportunity to explore his
      entrepreneurial side by developing his idea for power2give, but he recognized that the concept was intellectual
      property that belonged to his employer. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not the kind of thing you launch and then leave
      alone,&#x201D; he mused. &#x201C;In the future, what will be the best way to govern it? It&#x2019;s not core to
      ASC&#x2019;s mission. Do we grow it or sell it?&#x201D; (S. Provancher, personal communication, January 2011).
      Given the nature of employment in Project World, Provancher knew he would face a decision whether to go with
      power2give as it grows or remain in his leadership position with the ASC. </p>

    <p class="tx">Several concerns faced power2give as the platform rolled from its introductory stage toward
      responsible growth.</p>

    <a id="p354"></a>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">pricing it effectively so that all stakeholders&#x2014;donors, host organizations, and project
        organizers&#x2014;perceived good value for dollars exchanged</li>
      <li class="bl">persuading local host organizations and project organizers that the fund-raising model as a concept
        could work, which meant enhancing their capacity for marketing using social media</li>
      <li class="bl">fearing that project listings on power2give could potentially cannibalize other kinds of giving
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tx">What happened next for Provancher, the ASC of Charlotte-Mecklenburg, and the power2give platform?
      &#x201C;Ultimately, ASC realized it wasn&#x2019;t in the national crowdfunding business,&#x201D; he said in a 2017
      follow-up interview (S. Provancher, author interview, November 30, 2017). The platform itself was viable, but the
      ASC leadership decided it would be a better fit for a company with greater mission alignment to managing a
      platform for a national market. </p>

    <p class="tx">In October 2016 the ASC sold the intellectual property and technology that comprised power2give to
      Fractured Atlas, a&#xA0;nonprofit&#xA0;technology company providing business tools for&#xA0;artists and nonprofit
      organizations. &#x201C;It made much more sense for it to reside with Fractured Atlas, than ASC trying to keep
      control of it but not have the resources to scale it to its full potential,&#x201D; Provancher (personal
      communication, January 2011) said.</p>

    <p class="tx">Regarding the challenges facing power2give itemized above, Theresa Hubbard of Fractured Atlas observed
      that while there are now more platforms that offer the ability to make tax-deductible donations, the power2give
      platform incorporates a fiscal sponsorship model, which remains an important differentiator. The platform also
      reduces the administrative burden on the fund-raising organization. Power2give no longer offers as much
      comarketing and training support as originally envisioned, but local curators (formerly known as local host
      organizations) can do so. Fractured Atlas has selected a price that is &#x201C;fair to all users, while still
      being competitive,&#x201D; Hubbard (author interview, November 22, 2017) said. </p>

    <p class="tx">Time proved that fears about fund-raisers&#x2019; lack of experience with social media marketing and
      cannibalization of other forms of fund-raising were unfounded. Hubbard said, &#x201C;Nonprofits use crowdfunding
      for specific projects, but turn to more traditional methods of fund-raising for their ongoing activities&#x201D;
      (T. Hubbard, author interview, November 22, 2017). Fractured Atlas planned to roll power2give into its own branded
      crowdfunding platform. </p>

    <p class="tx">Provancher has since left the ASC to form his own professional consulting business to provide services
      to the nonprofit sector and the people who fund them. &#x201C;You have concepts, ideas, and projects on one side,
      and the capital resources to make them happen on the other side, and I saw a lot of opportunity to improve how the
      people, the ideas, and the capital work together,&#x201D; Provancher (personal communication, January 2011) said.
      He launched Lewis &amp; Clark with a focus on strategic consulting on fund-raising campaigns for nonprofits. In
      2016 that company acquired Ignite Philanthropy Advisors, which advised foundations on grant making, thus bringing
      together services for fund-raisers and donors. Today Provancher leads a thriving company rebranded as Ignite
      Philanthropy. Still entrepreneurial in his thinking, he envisions a business model that allows him to scale
      through acquisition of similar consulting firms in midsize cities across the United States. &#x201C;We see
      philanthropy as the sector we serve&#x2014;not the projects, not the donors, not the nonprofits, but all of that,
      together,&#x201D; Provancher (personal communication, January 2011) said. </p>

    <a id="p355"></a>
    <p class="tx">Provancher&#x2019;s advice: &#x201C;Whatever your role, there&#x2019;s always an opportunity no one
      has identified yet. You can always tweak, change, or even blow up the model. Entrepreneurs always try to
      understand the ultimate customer, and keep asking &#x2018;what could we be testing?&#x2019;&#x201D; (S.
      Provancher, personal communication, January 2011).</p>

    <p class="tx">The example of power2give proves that an organization can do well by doing good&#x2014;and that an
      individual with a talent for marketing and the spark for entrepreneurship can have real impact (S. Provancher,
      personal communication, January 2011; S. Provancher, author interview, November 30, 2017).</p>

    <div class="box-1">
      <h1 class="h1_green"><strong>Challenge Question</strong></h1>
      <p class="tx">It&#x2019;s not hard to see the levels of responsibility evident in Scott Provancher&#x2019;s work
        with the ASC to develop power2give. But what about an employee who brings an innovative idea to a more
        traditional, profit-driven organization? Imagine instead a Procter &amp; Gamble employee who comes up with a new
        product that serves a real market need but doesn&#x2019;t fit the mission of any of the company&#x2019;s
        strategic business units. How do you think the story would develop?</p>

    <h2 class="eoc-h2" id="ch10keyideas">Key Ideas to Remember</h2>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="bl">Marketers have a responsibility to serve the public&#x2019;s well-being. Marketing has been
        criticized for its negative impacts on individuals, businesses, and society. Companies are realizing that
        today&#x2019;s consumers, investors, and other stakeholders expect ethical marketing practices. Organizations
        large and small, local and global, are expected to adhere to behavior that is socially responsible, culturally
        sensitive, and sustainable in terms of the entire market system&#x2014;not merely one organization&#x2019;s
        self-interest. Companies that practice corporate social responsibility find it attracts investors, motivates
        employees, engages consumers, and helps establish a brand position that reduces competition solely on price.
      </li>
      <li class="bl">Responsibility to the planet responds to consumers&#x2019; concerns about ecological degradation
        and their desire to do business with companies that share humanity-centric values. Green marketing is
        characterized by practices that minimize the impacts of production processes, packaging, and marketing
        communication.</li>
      <li class="bl">Marketers must take responsibility for advancing the field of marketing toward higher standards of
        professionalism. This responsibility requires preparation, including maintaining knowledge of applicable laws
        and ethical codes, engaging in continuing education, and participating in professional associations. Marketers
        must work within ethical boundaries, which includes avoiding deceptive communications, protecting
        individuals&#x2019; privacy, and bringing transparency to organizational behavior.</li>
      <li class="bl">Marketers are accountable to their employer organizations. This responsibility includes supporting
        positive perception of the brand, maintaining good relationships with channel partners, and contributing
        personally to value creation. When rhetoric becomes divorced from actual behavior, no one benefits; everyone in
        the organization must walk the talk of ethical marketing.</li>
      <li class="bl">All workers must take responsibility for their careers. Tom Peters foresaw a workplace in which
        careers consist of increasingly challenging, influential projects that build loyal relationships but do not
        resemble the traditional climb up a corporate hierarchy. He saw a workplace full of free agents who build their
        personal brands by applying marketing principles like positioning a brand, developing a unique value
        proposition, and establishing clear competitive differentiation. While not everyone will be comfortable adopting
        Peters&#x2019;s Brand You approach to his or her career, all must commit to doing original work; filling gaps in
        skills, knowledge, and abilities; and maintaining appropriate boundaries regarding self-promotion for
        advancement.</li>
      <li class="bl">The marketing profession offers many opportunities for satisfying work experiences, suited to a
        wide range of personalities and talents. Individuals are responsible for finding a career path that allows them
        to do their best work while contributing value to their employer. Some marketers work in organizations, while
        others work in agencies that provide specialized services to those organizations, such as advertising or social
        media marketing. Some marketers become entrepreneurs who create organizations around their innovative ideas.
        It&#x2019;s not uncommon for individuals to move among different career paths in marketing. Wherever you find
        your niche, your success will derive from your ability to adapt and reinvent yourself and your work as business
        practices change over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <a id="p356"></a>
    <h2 class="eoc-h2" id="ch10criticalthinking">Critical-Thinking Questions</h2>

    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="nl">Do you agree that marketing should be considered socially beneficial? Or do you agree with critics
        who counter that marketing is harmful to individuals, businesses, and society? Choose a side and make your case,
        recalling the arguments presented in this chapter and adding your own.</li>
      <li class="nl">Businesses are increasingly investing resources in sustainability efforts. Do you think this is
        because it is the &#x201C;right thing to do&#x201D;? Or is it motivated by a desire to increase profits, to
        attract customers who value sustainability efforts, or perhaps to cut costs?</li>
      <li class="nl">Describe ethical considerations with regard to marketing to children. When the marketers&#x2019;
        pitch includes a cause component, such as a breakfast cereal that promises to provide breakfasts to
        undernourished schoolchildren, is marketing to children more ethically acceptable?</li>
      <li class="nl">Vicks&#x2019; use of behavioral targeting to promote its Behind Ear Thermometer illustrated use of
        personal data by a company outside the relationship between the consumer and the mobile apps with which that
        data had been shared. This is perfectly legal. But is it ethical? At what point does commercial use of personal
        data constitute abuse of the public&#x2019;s trust?</li>
      <li class="nl">Use of brand ambassadors and product placement were cited in this chapter as examples that blur the
        boundary between promotional messages and other kinds of communication. How can an average consumer know when a
        pitch is being made, and by whom? What steps do you feel marketers should take to make sure their tactics are
        not deceptive?</li>
      <li class="nl">Consider your purchase behavior as a consumer: Do you looking for the lowest prices? Do you take
        into account the reputation of brands you consider? If your behavior is typical of most consumers, do you feel
        that companies can afford to be socially responsible and still be competitive? Give evidence to support your
        answer.</li>
      <li class="nl">Evaluate individuals&#x2019; ability to affect the social responsibility of their employers&#x2019;
        brands. This might involve responsibility to channel partners, as in the hypothetical example of SkyView Foods
        in this chapter, or responsibility to customers, as in the highly publicized occurrence in 2017 of Wells Fargo
        Bank employees creating 1.4 million fake accounts as a result of a corporate culture of high-pressure sales. If
        you were an employee of SkyView Foods or Wells Fargo Bank, what steps could you take to improve your
        employer&#x2019;s social responsibility? </li>
      <li class="nl">How might you apply the insights of permission marketing&#x2014;that true one-to-one relationships
        are built on an agreement to accept contact between seller and buyer&#x2014;to your search for a job in the
        marketing field?</li>
      <li class="nl">In your judgment, should a company invest in individuals who adhere to the Brand You philosophy
        that places loyalty to self ahead of loyalty to an employer? Why or why not?</li>
    </ul>
