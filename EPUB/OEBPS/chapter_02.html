<h1 class="h1" id="ch02intro">Introduction</h1>

<p class="tx">The U.S. corrections enterprise is enormous. At the end of 2016, there were approximately 6,613,500 adults under correctional authority (Kaeble &amp; Cowhig, 2018). This includes approximately 1,505,400 people in state and federal prisons, 740,700 in jails, 3,673,100 on probation, and 874,800 on parole (Kaeble &amp; Cowhig, 2018). Probation and parole totals also include those under extended supervision in the community.</p>

<p class="tx">In a country of over 300 million, there were approximately 2,640 people per 100,000 adult residents under correctional supervision as of 2016, or 1 in 38 adults in the United States (Kaeble &amp; Cowhig, 2018). These numbers are astounding. (See <em>Applying Criminal Justice: California&rsquo;s Prison Overcrowding Dilemma</em>, later in this chapter, for more on this topic.) Between 2007 and 2016, however, there was an 18% reduction in the number of adults under correctional supervision (Kaeble &amp; Cowhig, 2018). Figure 2.1 shows the number of adults under various forms of correctional authority. </p>

<p class="tx">The number of adults under correctional authority (probation, parole, jail, or prison) rose steadily from the 1980s through the early 2000s. However, since 2007 that number has been in decline.</p>

<p class="tx">Corrections efforts are organized at various levels of political autonomy in the United States. In other words, there are corrections organizations at federal, state, and local levels. Each level features organizations that have been established as a result of the authority and capacities of these governing bodies to create, fund, and operate them.</p>

<a id="p25"></a>

<p class="tx">This chapter describes the very large corrections organizations that exist and operate at federal and state levels of government. Keep in mind that corrections functions are parceled out among the various governmental levels, that no one organization has the authority or scope of operation to carry out or administer all the corrections functions at the federal level, and that corrections efforts are not entirely centralized under one organization (such as a Department or Division of Corrections) in any of the 50 states. In addition to governmental agencies, there are many private correctional efforts and organizations, both nonprofit and for-profit. This chapter focuses on governmental correctional agencies. (Subsequent chapters of this book will examine private correctional entities.) It also examines both correctional aims and the correctional menu.</p>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec2.1">2.1&ensp;Correctional Aims</h1>

<p class="tx"><strong>Correctional aims</strong> are the varied purposes of corrections. They are made up of many competing and often contradictory objectives. For our purposes, we can identify six primary correctional aims: retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, reintegration, and restoration.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Retribution</h2>
<p class="tx"><strong>Retribution</strong> is the application of punishment as the primary response to criminal wrongdoing. The aim of retribution is singular in that it does not seek any further aim outside of punishment. &ldquo;The retributivist believes that the punishment is right in itself&rdquo; (Close &amp; Meier, 1995, p. 423). Retribution also holds that the role of correctional agencies is to exact punishment as defined by law. The punishment a correctional agency applies may take many forms. Take, for example, deprivation of liberty, which typically involves placing an offender inside a correctional facility. Other punishments include exacting a monetary fine for committing a criminal act. (See <em>Applying Criminal Justice: How Much Punishment Is Enough?</em> for further discussion on this topic.) Factors associated with punishment and proportionality have long attracted outside inquiry. Deigh (2014) notes that proportionality &ldquo;bears on the question of how the severity of legal punishment is to be matched to the seriousness of the crimes for which it is inflicted&rdquo; (p. 191). Deigh&rsquo;s work explores the challenges in connecting and considering proportionality between an offense and punishment.</p>


<div class="box-2">
<h1 class="h1"><strong>Applying Criminal Justice:</strong> <em>How Much Punishment Is Enough?</em></h1>

<p class="tx">Retribution has always been part of the American landscape of correctional aims. As noted scholar Robert Johnson (2002) has stated, it is impossible to think about American corrections history without acknowledging the element of punishment as a main driver among correctional aims. In fact, many are quick to point out that since the 1980s the American response to crime has fostered a mass incarceration movement with an emphasis on retribution, with imprisonment as its most direct expression. For many citizens, prisons will continue to be the primary way to view corrections, even though as of 2016 nearly 70% of those under correctional supervision reside in the community (Kaeble &amp; Cowhig, 2018). Punishment has always been associated with prisons, but recently the idea that community supervision can fulfill the requisite need for punishment has gained ground. So when we think of punishment, we must think of all correctional options available to us, both institutional and community-based.</p>

<a id="p26"></a>

<p class="tx">Yet how much punishment is enough? What is known about the effects of punishment? What is the difference between, for example, a punishment of 1 year in prison and 2 years in prison? Spending an additional 365 days incarcerated means something different to the offender than it does to, say, a politician or a victim or an ordinary citizen. How does society determine how much and what type of punishment is enough or too much? Interestingly, European countries use prisons more sparsely, and punishments for criminal wrongdoing are less severe, at least as measured by the use of imprisonment. Why are European penalties less severe when it comes to imprisonment? Why do Americans seem more interested in punishment or retribution, expressed through imprisonment, as opposed to other correctional aims?</p>
</div>

<h2 class="h2">Deterrence</h2>

<p class="tx"><strong>Deterrence</strong> is another correctional aim associated with punishment. This aim is designed to send a message both to an offender and to society that an offense is unacceptable. Many utilitarians view criminal sanction and punishment as a means to coerce offenders into living law-abiding lifestyles (known as <em>specific deterrence</em>) and to encourage or coerce nonoffenders to do the same by making the punishments for certain crimes exceedingly clear (known as <em>general deterrence</em>). The logic of deterrence is based on the idea that individuals have free will, make rational choices about their behaviors, and will choose positive consequences over negative ones. This logic presumes that individuals will avoid negative consequences when they are reasonably sure these will result from an action. </p>

<p class="tx">In reality, however, this logic may be problematic. Take, for example, the lack of awareness that ordinary people have regarding the criminal sanctions for specific crimes and particular persons. If a citizen is unaware of what punishment an offender received for committing a crime, then he or she cannot calculate the possible result of committing that crime him- or herself; thus, the potential deterrent effect is lost. Similarly, the experience of an individual who receives a criminal sanction may not be sufficient to result in a change to his or her behavior. </p>

<h2 class="h2">Incapacitation</h2>
<p class="tx">As a correctional aim, <strong>incapacitation</strong> involves restraining an offender such that future criminal wrongdoing is impossible. This is commonly attempted by placing offenders in jails or prisons&mdash;removing an offender from the community, restricting his or her liberty, and hopefully placing him or her in a situation where it is impossible to commit another crime. Realistically, however, simply removing the offender from the community does not guarantee that he or she cannot commit another offense&mdash;offenders can commit further crimes while they are incarcerated. Another example of incapacitation is the use of medication to prevent sex offenders from committing further offenses. This form of incapacitation is highly controversial; nevertheless, it is part of the repertoire associated with the incapacitation aim. Incarcerating an offender tends to typify incapacitation, but correctional aims may be studied in conjunction with one another, as indicated in the work of Berenji, Chou, and D&rsquo;Orsogna (2014), which considers the effects of incarceration when combined with rehabilitation.</p>

<div class="p-ct">Rehabilitation methods can take many forms, such as inmates caring for injured animals at a wildlife center. Can you think of other rehabilitation methods corrections facilities might employ?</div>
</div>

<h2 class="h2">Rehabilitation</h2>

<p class="tx"><strong>Rehabilitation</strong> attempts to change the offender&rsquo;s behavior from negative and criminal to positive and law abiding. The change process is directed at some type of deficiency the offender may have, such as behavioral issues and/or a criminogenic environment. Possible deficiencies among offenders are numerous, and it is the role of corrections to identify and address these in ways that enable positive change to occur and be sustained over time. Rehabilitative programming is wide and varied in correctional environments; it attempts to address those deficiencies that are the most highly correlated with criminal offending. Indeed, there are many types of programs that address offender deficiencies. Some take place in institutional settings, while others may operate in communities. Much of the research has suggested that for rehabilitation to be effective in correctional environments (that is, in institutional or community-based facilities), there must be adequate attention paid to offenders&rsquo; <em>risk</em> and <em>needs</em> and to the proper classification of offenders along these dimensions (Latessa &amp; Lovins, 2010). The role of correctional agencies is to promote offenders&rsquo; proper assessment and classification along the dimensions of risk and need and to create an appropriate management plan that will facilitate effective change.</p>

<div class="video-caption">Rehabilitation is a main approach to crime and punishment in Texas.

</div>

<p class="tx">As a correctional aim, rehabilitation has been a part of the corrections domain for over 150 years, though it has been very controversial. Early critics sought to show that rehabilitative programming had &ldquo;no appreciable effect on recidivism rates&rdquo; (Martinson, 1974), while others with more retributivist leanings criticized rehabilitation on moral and logical grounds, arguing that the utilitarian nature of rehabilitation was counter to the legitimate aim of the state to punish offenders for wrongdoing. Current proponents of rehabilitation argue that much empirical evidence supports the efficacy of properly conceived and implemented rehabilitative programming (Cullen &amp; Gilbert, 1982; Gendreau &amp; Ross, 1987; Latessa &amp; Lowenkamp, 2005; Petersilia, 2006). For example, Hall (2015) points to the importance of educational programming as a rehabilitative mechanism that may translate into lower recidivism, suggesting the need to construct rehabilitative programs that are informed by research. Peters, Hochstetler, DeLisi, and Kuo (2015) find that both participating in and completing rehabilitative programs lowers a parolee&rsquo;s risk of recidivism.</p>

<a id="p28"></a>

<h2 class="h2">Reintegration</h2>
<p class="tx">Reintegration has its roots in the social sciences. It is based on the premise that crime and delinquency are as much symptoms of community disorganization as they are evidence of individual offenders&rsquo; psychological and behavioral problems. According to McCarthy and McCarthy (1984), &ldquo;[Various social factors] . . . are all evidence of the community&rsquo;s failure to promote the development of law-abiding behavior&rdquo; (p. 6).</p>

<p class="tx">As a correctional aim, <strong>reintegration</strong> is most often regarded as using the community as a resource to help and encourage offenders to adjust to a law-abiding lifestyle. The &ldquo;community&rdquo; collaborates in this endeavor, in that conscious efforts are made to provide opportunities, such as employment, and other assistance to the individual as he or she learns to make use of legitimate life options. The offender is expected to adopt new attitudes and beliefs as the process continues and to translate these into law-abiding behavior.</p>

<p class="tx">Theoretically, encouraging and implementing the interactions and outcomes of a community corrections program is important and appealing. Nonetheless, in thinking about community corrections, there are several questions worth considering. First, what do we mean by <em>com</em><em>munity</em>? The term is meant to be encompassing, but it is difficult to determine standards for what <em>community</em> means in terms of community corrections. Second, what does it mean to reintegrate an offender in a practical sense? How do we define successful reintegration? Finally, what does it mean to implement a reintegration program? How do we monitor and assess reintegrative program results? Despite these questions, reintegration is a major part of many correctional agencies&rsquo; core activities. </p>

<h2 class="h2">Restoration</h2>
<p class="tx">The fundamental idea behind <strong>restoration</strong> is that offenders take responsibility for their actions and atone to victims as well as the larger community. Similar to reintegration, the community&rsquo;s role in restoration is to provide conditions under which offenders can successfully adjust and maintain law-abiding and acceptable lifestyles. As with other correctional aims, restoration is not without its concerns. In an attempt to implement restorative justice programs, the offender, the victim, the community, and elements of the criminal justice system must be willing to come to terms with crime and its consequences. In the end, restoration seeks to balance the needs of all parties so as to promote law-abiding behavior and restore the community. Clearly, there are enormous challenges associated with realizing this correctional aim.</p>

<a id="p29"></a>

<h2 class="h2">Competing Correctional Aims</h2>
<p class="tx">From the discussion thus far, it should be clear that there is no singular correctional aim. Fundamentally, correctional aims are the objectives and actions that society decides to pursue to address criminal offending. However, there is little consensus regarding which objectives and actions should be prioritized and pursued. In sentencing, for example, prosecutors and judges have no clear mandate concerning which correctional aims should take precedence in general or regarding particular offenders. There is sufficient discretion in sentencing so that prosecutors and judges may pursue one aim with certain individuals and another aim with others. They may also pursue multiple correctional aims and may not agree as individual actors within the criminal justice system that one aim is preferable to another. It is more likely that, in the day-to-day operations of the criminal justice system, the available options determine a particular offender&rsquo;s results, rather than a philosophical argument in support of a specific aim. This is not to suggest that prosecutors and judges do not consider multiple aims in their decision making; rather, the practical necessities of finding an option for an offender weigh heavily in the final decision. Prosecutors and judges, after all, live in the real world.</p>

<p class="tx">Most criminal offenders will receive sanctions that place them under correctional authority. Without a clear mandate for which correctional aims should take precedence, correctional personnel are forced to retreat to what they know and can actually accomplish&mdash;what they can control and do. But even this &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; decisional approach is not foolproof, since the degree to which these aims may be achievable is questionable. Corrections personnel are often pulled in different directions as they are asked to achieve multiple correctional aims, some of which may be unachievable.</p>

<p class="tx">For example, consider how prisons are operated. The reality is that prison is not a setting that is conducive to rehabilitation, even if effective rehabilitation programs exist in some prisons. Incarceration pits two major aims against one another: incapacitation and rehabilitation. Yet in some states&mdash;California, for example&mdash;the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation&rsquo;s publicly expressed mission is to protect the community via incapacitation, as well as to rehabilitate offenders while they are imprisoned. The result in this state has been litigation that has questioned the corrections department&rsquo;s ability to operate prisons in a manner that promotes rehabilitation. In fact, due to the state&rsquo;s inability to accomplish rehabilitative goals, and given the premature deaths of inmates under the state&rsquo;s supervision, the U.S. Supreme court deemed California&rsquo;s operations to be unconstitutional and set a 2-year timeline for it to comply with an order to reduce the inmate population by 40,000 prisoners (<em>Brown v. Plata</em>, 2011). The scale of this ruling implicates a variety of issues, including the effects of correction population reductions on policy, reintegration, and associated factors and considerations for local jurisdictions in California (Petersilia, 2014). </p>

<p class="tx">If you were to examine other correctional aims in relation to one another, you would find many other contradictions that make the work of corrections more difficult. At the end of the day, correction officials define their tasks in ways that allow them to function without requiring them to resolve the issues of competing demands.</p>

<a id="p30"></a>
<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec2.2">2.2&ensp;Correctional Strategies</h1>

<p class="tx">As a society, decisions about how best to address criminal behavior are often politically motivated. These decisions are influenced by previous political choices and by available correctional methods. While correctional aims can point us in the right direction, the menu of options to accomplish those aims&mdash;the <strong>correctional menu</strong>&mdash;is limited. Historically, retribution has been a dominant aim (see Chapter 1), although other aims have been emphasized at various times. For example, imprisonment as a form of incarceration has been a central strategy in the United States since the early 19th century. However, whether incarceration achieves any of the correctional aims has been largely irrelevant. As Foucault (1975/1995) states in <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, a correctional strategy&mdash;in this case incarceration&mdash;continues or fades away based on whether its effects are politically palatable to those in power. This does not mean a strategy&rsquo;s longevity depends on whether it definitively satisfies one or more correctional aims; rather, it means it depends on whether the strategy satisfies the interests of those in power.</p>

<p class="tx">It is also important to know that strategies in place for long periods of time tend to develop staying power as we invest in their operations and become more conceptually bound by them. Can you imagine an American correctional program that did not feature incarceration? Though we have tried alternative strategies, the use of incarceration as we know it remains, regardless of which correctional aims it does or does not satisfy. Speaking plainly, politicians can claim that prisons are protecting society and yet remain silent when asked what incarceration actually accomplishes. It is not our intention to dismiss incarceration as a strategy; however, it is important to understand that a strategy may remain in place because it satisfies other interests, regardless of whether it can be shown to satisfy specific correctional aims.</p>

<p class="tx">The United States has pursued three primary strategies regarding corrections. These are <em>incarceration</em>, <em>community-based corrections</em>, and <em>death</em>. </p>

<div class="p-ct">Incarceration is the one of the most familiar corrections strategies. Do you think it is the most appropriate and acceptable method of punishment?</div>
</div>

<h2 class="h2">Incarceration</h2>

<p class="tx">Simply put, <strong>incarceration</strong> involves the use of a correctional facility, typically a jail or prison, to house criminal offenders. Jails generally house individuals serving misdemeanor sentences (under 1 year) and individuals awaiting trial (pretrial detainees; see Chapter 3). Prisons generally house individuals serving felony sentences (over 1 year). In some states, however, the location (e.g., a local facility or state facility) in which an individual is placed legally determines the misdemeanor/felony distinction. For example, an individual placed in a local institution of confinement would be serving a misdemeanor sentence, whereas an individual placed in a state correctional facility would be a serving a felony sentence. Incarceration attempts to satisfy the aim of retribution. Since the 1830s we have envisioned the deprivation of liberty as punishment (Welch, 2011). When we incarcerate offenders in jails or prisons, we aim to achieve retribution. Remember, retribution&rsquo;s purpose is punishment in and of itself.</p>

<a id="p31"></a>

<p class="tx">In addition, we view incarceration as a way to further the aim of deterrence, both specific and general. Recall that <em>specific deterrence</em> refers to an offender becoming a law-abiding citizen, while <em>general deterrence</em> refers to providing incentives for law-abiding citizens to comply with society&rsquo;s laws. There are some problems with the logic of deterrence that go beyond the scope of this text, but in general, it is difficult to prove whether incarceration achieves this aim. Nevertheless, deterrence will continue to be a major aim of the U.S. corrections system.</p>

<p class="tx">Incarceration also serves the aim of incapacitation. In most cases confining an offender within a jail or prison temporarily removes this person from the community and hence achieves some form of protection. The idea is that the offender cannot then commit crimes in the community during that time period. By incapacitating some criminals, we are aiming to directly prevent crime in society. This is the expressed expectation; however, there is limited evidence to suggest that incarceration is directly related to crime prevention. To begin with, incarceration is not a strategy for addressing all crime. Take, for example, the issue of incapacitation affecting the &ldquo;crime rate.&rdquo; The crime rate is an aggregate measure of crimes, including many for which incarceration is not a strategy&mdash;for example, crimes such as disorderly conduct. Using incarceration for this crime would be overkill&mdash;not the most effective way to address the crime. Instead, incarceration is a primary strategy for specific, serious crimes, such as murder, sexual assault, and kidnapping. Even for these crimes, however, there is little evidence that incarceration has a direct preventive effect. Sophisticated research suggests that incarceration is not an effective crime prevention strategy (Zimring &amp; Hawkins, 1997). Werminkn, Apel, Nieuwbeerta, and Blokland (2013) find &ldquo;that in as far as imprisonment is used with the primary goal of reducing crime, a general increase of imprisonment as the sanction of choice is not likely to yield high crime control bene&#64257;ts&rdquo; (p. 596). </p>

<p class="tx">As previously noted, it is also important to consider how incarceration may work in conjunction with other correctional factors. In their review of the effects of incarceration, Berenji et al. (2014) focus on the type and duration of rehabilitative efforts implemented upon release, as well as the effects of incarceration in conjunction with rehabilitative efforts after release. Their work suggests that incarceration effects may be understood as an influence that may be combined with other factors. However, of all the correctional aims, rehabilitation is the least likely result of incarceration. Research suggests that even if rehabilitation programming is correctly conceptualized and implemented among incarcerated populations, the impact on reoffending rates is a modest 8% to 10% (Petersilia, 2007). Berenji et al. (2014) conclude that, instead, &ldquo;a mixture of sufficient punishment and long&#8208;lasting assistance efforts upon release may be the most effective way to reduce crime&rdquo; (pp. 10&ndash;11). The prospect of achieving rehabilitation through incarceration is unlikely, partially because the physical and operational environments of jails and prisons are not conducive to rehabilitation (Johnson, 2002; Stojkovic, 2010). Notwithstanding these concerns, the aim of rehabilitating through incarceration is still very popular among correctional professionals, although objectives related to this aim may be unrealistic and possibly create other problems for correctional agencies. For example, consider the position of correctional officials who are asked to rehabilitate offenders and have limited means to accomplish this task. This and other problems will be addressed in later chapters.</p>

<a id="p32"></a>

<p class="tx">Incarceration conflicts with the aim of reintegration. Incarcerated offenders are removed from the community and then, after their sentence is served, need to be reintroduced back into the community. The longer offenders are kept out of their communities, the more likely that there will be problems reintroducing them. Consider an offender who is imprisoned for 3 years. She is very likely to lose ties with her family, friends, and others. She will have lost her job and likely has little structure to return to in the community. While situations vary&mdash;for example, some inmates have family waiting for them upon their release&mdash;most will lack resources and support. Most inmates will need to find a new place to live, need financial support, and require assistance to get a job; some will need mental and other health services or other general support. Recall that in the United States, as of 2016 there were approximately 1.5 million persons in prison and 740,700 in local jails (Kaeble &amp; Cowhig, 2018). Later chapters will show there are many solid reintegration efforts across the country; however, given the number of offenders and the range of issues they face upon their release, the resources available to accomplish reintegration are meager in the face of the scale and scope of the problem. As a result, achieving reintegration through incarceration is quite difficult.</p>

<p class="tx">The degree to which incarceration promotes the aim of restoration depends on the role it plays in the restorative process. If being incarcerated in a correctional facility promotes law-abiding behavior, then it can be seen as supporting restoration. Also, if a specific form of incarceration allows for limited community release and interaction and promotes restitution, then it too can be regarded as supporting restoration. However, the United States has more than 150 years&rsquo; experience incarcerating offenders, and there is little definitive evidence to suggest that incarceration, as we have done it, advances restoration. There are many restorative justice efforts underway in the United States (discussed in Chapter 7), and some of these use the threat of incarceration to secure compliance with restorative efforts. In these instances, incarceration itself is not the restorative element. In addition, these efforts generally focus on less serious offenses and misdemeanors, such as minor theft, first-offense drunk driving, vandalism, and disorderly conduct with community members. Given the United States&rsquo; experience, it is fair to say that the relationship between incarceration and restoration is tenuous.</p>

<p class="tx">Recall from Chapter 1 that community-based corrections refers to the array of programs found in the community to address crime and the criminal offender. There are many community-based correctional efforts of varied philosophies and forms. In general, the idea is to keep the offender in the community rather than separate him or her via incarceration. The offender operates in the community with some measure of supervision and structure. In some cases, he or she participates in correctional programs that promote reintegration. The intent of community-based corrections is to promote law-abiding behavior. These efforts may fall under the umbrellas of probation, parole, and extended supervision or under specialized programs implemented by public or private social service agencies. The essential elements are the community setting and community resources, beyond correctional agencies. As is true of incarceration, community-based efforts attempt to achieve multiple aims.</p>

<a id="p33"></a>

<p class="tx">Typically, community-based correctional efforts are not developed or implemented in such a way as to achieve further retribution. Some retributivists argue against community-based efforts because retribution as a sentencing goal tends to prioritize justice through punishment, while community-based correctional efforts tend to emphasize rehabilitation rather than punishment.</p>

<p class="tx">For the individual offender, community-based efforts may promote law-abiding behavior and thus may be regarded as supporting specific deterrence. However, community-based efforts are often invisible to most members of the community, so it is difficult to measure how well these efforts promote general deterrence. In fact, some argue that community-based efforts, in some of their forms, may not be regarded as punishment and thus would not have a deterrent effect. Although scant research has been done on the general deterrent effect of community-based efforts, some work points to other aims of community-based corrections. For example, in exploring objectives for community programs that emphasize deterrence, Klingele (2015) asserts that such programs should aim to equip persons on probation with supervision that focuses on &ldquo;engaging the probationer&rdquo; to identify &ldquo;root causes of offending&rdquo; and that provides links &ldquo;to prosocial influences in the community&rdquo; (p. 1662). While community-based efforts have indeed been developed and implemented to further individual behavioral change, and thus specific deterrence&mdash;for example, in drug treatment courts&mdash;they have not been developed and implemented to further <em>general</em> deterrence.</p>

<p class="tx">Community-based correctional efforts sometimes feature limited incapacitation. This might take the form of a &ldquo;split sentence,&rdquo; whereby the offender spends some time in a correctional facility and then is placed under <strong>community supervision</strong>, which uses the community as a resource with which to manage offenders. Most community-based programs do not utilize incapacitation, as the traditional aim of incapacitation has little to do with most community-based efforts. In fact, some would consider it a contradiction to use community-based corrections to further the aim of incapacitation.</p>

<p class="tx">Some people might expect that community-based corrections would promote rehabilitation. Efforts are directed toward the offender and changing his or her behavior, so in the most general sense, rehabilitation may be seen as a legitimate community correctional aim. There is an intuitive appeal to this connection; however, similar to what was stated regarding prison rehabilitation programs, it may be difficult to see how the rehabilitative aim is actually accomplished. In addition, many community-based efforts are developed and implemented under the rubric of reintegration rather than rehabilitation. Herein lies a difficulty. How can we separate the effects of two possibly competing correctional aims? Not much research has been done into the rehabilitative effects of community-based corrections. Still, a link between community corrections and rehabilitation is possible and reasonable. Klingele (2015) finds that programs may promote both deterrence and rehabilitative objectives when they equip an individual under supervision with the knowledge &ldquo;(1) that prohibited behavior will be detected and (2) that an immediate, negative consequence is certain to accompany any detected violation&rdquo; (p. 1663). </p>

<a id="p34"></a>

<p class="tx">Reintegration is perhaps the traditional correctional aim most consistent with community corrections. In a practical sense, communities do not have a single set of values or a defined set of standards, other than the criminal law, to guide an offender&rsquo;s reintegration. Therefore, reintegration may involve promoting law-abiding behavior as a realistic objective. In some cases, community-based programming is designed to reintegrate an offender into the community after a period of incarceration. In this way the link between community-based corrections and the aim of reintegration may be regarded as well established. The research of Gunnison, Helfgott, and Wilhelm (2015) provides an opportunity to consider reintegration issues from the viewpoint of corrections practitioners. Gunnison et al. (2015) assert that &ldquo;one of the most problematic issues in the reentry process is the disconnection between institutional and community contexts.&rdquo; Their findings indicate that correctional practitioners identify programs, housing, and employment as important factors for reintegration and &ldquo;highlight the great need for resources . . . both in-house and in the community, in order to foster successful reentry&rdquo; (p. 49).</p>

<p class="tx">While some community-based efforts have restoration as an objective, many do not. Restoration involves balancing the needs of the offender, the community, and the victim. For restoration to have any meaning in the context of community corrections, however, there must be a discernible structure and an explicit intent to achieve that balance. Probation as it is usually practiced, for example, does not have restoration as an operating principle. On the other hand, efforts such as &ldquo;sentencing circles&rdquo;&mdash;in which community members and offenders jointly participate in determining the offender&rsquo;s responsibility and the ways in which the offender, the community, and the victim will be restored&mdash;are examples of restoration in action. However, this type of community correctional effort is seldom seen. The link between community corrections and restoration is difficult to discern, and more research needs to be done on this topic to determine the impact of community corrections on restoration. </p>

<div class="p-ct">The death penalty is perhaps one of the most controversial corrections methods. Do you think the death penalty is necessary? Why or why not?</div>
</div>

<h2 class="h2">The Death Penalty</h2>

<p class="tx">There is a direct link between the correctional aim of retribution and the implementation of the <strong>death penalty</strong>, the taking of an offender&rsquo;s life. Thirty-eight states and the federal government allow the death penalty for the crime of specific forms of homicide. At the close of 2016, 2,814 people in 32 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) had received a death sentence, though the number of people who have received a death sentence has declined each year since 2000 (Davis &amp; Snell, 2018). For the retributivist, the death penalty may be viewed as &ldquo;just deserts&rdquo; and as a means to further other aims. For others, the death penalty is an excessive and unnecessary sanction. The debate regarding the death penalty makes it a very controversial correctional method (see Chapter 10 for further examination of the death penalty).</p>

<a id="p35"></a>

<p class="tx">Many argue that the death penalty has a direct link to deterrence. No one can argue that the death penalty, when executed, fails to have a specific deterrent effect&mdash;after all, the offender is dead. However, many would argue there is little convincing evidence of the death penalty&rsquo;s general deterrent effect. While it is easy see a link between death and <em>specific</em> deterrence, it is problematic to make such a connection between the death penalty and <em>general</em> deterrence.</p>

<p class="tx">There is also a direct link between the death penalty and incapacitation. In death, an offender is clearly rendered unable to commit future crimes. Additionally, a death penalty sentence places many offenders on &ldquo;death row,&rdquo; where the average length of stay prior to execution is about 15 years (Snell, 2011). In fact, this average is increasing in part due to legal challenges to the death penalty. For the average offender on death row, then, waiting years to be executed achieves incapacitation through incarceration. </p>

<p class="tx">There is no clear link between the death penalty and rehabilitation because there is no reasonable way to affirm that the death penalty has a rehabilitative effect. Similarly, a link between the death penalty and reintegration is difficult if not impossible to establish. In the case of restoration, some may argue that the execution of the death penalty restores the balance of a community and a victim by permanently removing the offender. However, this is a matter of perspective, since others may argue that the death penalty disturbs the balance of the government&rsquo;s legitimate interest to punish and each individual&rsquo;s right to life.</p>

<div class="p-ct">There are fewer federal prisons than state ones. This shortage sometimes necessitates that federal detainees be sent to local jails. Do you think this is fair? Why or why not?</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">At the federal level, corrections functions are divided primarily among the BOP (a component of the U.S. Department of Justice), the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services (organized within the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, with agents attached to U.S. district courts, also providing parole supervision services), and the U.S. Parole Commission (a semiautonomous body). Certain functions are assigned to others. For example, the BOP can only accommodate about one third of federal pretrial detainees. The U.S. Marshals Service is responsible for pretrial detainees and for contracting space in local jail facilities for these accused persons. In these arrangements, corrections functions at this level of government are not strictly centralized, with one agency responsible for policy development, allocation of resources, and centralized management. Nonetheless, the degree of coordination is significant.</p>


<p class="tx">The BOP was created in 1930 to provide for the administration and operation of federal correctional facilities. The BOP operates more than 115 facilities. Table 2.1 includes demographics on the inmate populations for the BOP. </p>

<p class="tx">As of July 2018 there were 183,981 inmates under the federal correctional authority (Federal Bureau of Prisons [BOP], 2018). In the late 1980s changes in federal sentencing policy and the abolition of parole, together with intensified federal law enforcement efforts, especially in the area of drug smuggling and related offenses, produced a dramatic rise in the federal prisoner population over the next 20 years. Today, however, the federal correctional population is currently in decline, consistent with overall correctional population trends (see Figure 2.2). </p>

<p class="tx">Agents of the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services provide community supervision (i.e., probation and parole) of federal offenders. As noted above, these agents carry out their responsibilities under the auspices of the U.S. district courts. Organizationally, this makes federal probation a bit complicated. With federal probation officers attached to the district courts and the chief probation officer working closely with the presiding judge of the district, federal probation is not actually as centralized as the federal prison system. By 1988, approximately 60,000 people (45,000 males and 15,000 females) were on federal probation, and approximately 18,500 persons (17,400 males and 1,100 females) were on federal parole. At that time, approximately 38% of federal offenders under correctional authority were incarcerated, and approximately 62% were under community supervision. As of 2016, there were 131,700 people under federal probation and parole supervision, which is approximately 41% of the 320,000 people then under federal correctional authority, showing an increase since 1988 (Kaeble &amp; Cowhig, 2018). As the changes at the federal level produce effects, monitoring this ratio is one way to examine the place of incarceration in the federal government&rsquo;s strategy.</p>

<p class="tx">Parole release decisions at the federal level are a function of the U.S. Parole Commission. With the implementation of determinate sentencing guidelines in 1988, however, federal parole has been abolished. Those sentenced under the new guidelines fall under a mandatory release mechanism (discussed further in Chapter 8). Those who entered federal facilities prior to implementation of the guidelines still fall under the authority of the U.S. Parole Commission, which will continue to function until that category of offender has been cycled out of the corrections system. As of 2018 the U.S. Parole Commission still functions pursuant to its legislative mandate (U.S. Department of Justice, n.d.).</p>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec2.4">2.4&ensp;Corrections at the State Level</h1>

<p class="tx">Corrections at the state level typically combine local, state, and federal government efforts that work simultaneously. We could say that such an arrangement is a decentralized pattern. Such arrangements allow for local control of and influence over certain corrections efforts (i.e., jails, local probation, juvenile services), while other efforts pertaining to those sentenced to state or federal authority are separately administered.</p>

<p class="tx">Decentralized arrangements are sometimes criticized for duplication of services, their competition for resources in a given locale, their lack of central accountability, and the potential for correctional practices to vary across and within jurisdictions. The strongest arguments for such arrangements focus on the potential to align correctional practices (ostensibly those that are locally controlled) with the perceived needs and expectations of the local population, resulting in community-oriented practice.</p>

<p class="tx">In some states (Delaware, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin), corrections functions are more highly unified at the state level. In other words, with the exception of jails and related programs, corrections functions (such as adult probation and parole services, as well as juvenile probation and aftercare services) are provided through the central authority of the state Department of Corrections. The typical pattern is to divide the state into regions or service areas and assign offenders to field service offices that are administratively organized under the central authority. </p>

<p class="tx">Arguments in favor of such an arrangement emphasize central accountability&mdash;that is, instead of several agencies performing similar tasks, with control spread among several governing bodies, control and administration are unified under one agency. It is also argued that this model offers greater efficiency in terms of allocating resources, because it allows for one large budget rather than many smaller ones. It also affords an opportunity to allocate resources across jurisdictions, making it more likely that resources will be distributed according to identified needs. This arrangement also offers the ability to more closely monitor practices to provide greater consistency of criteria and the authority to evaluate across jurisdictions, as well as the benefits that stem from economy of scale&mdash;that is, flexibility in how personnel and resources are used, and the ability to consolidate functions and positions. Criticisms of such arrangements typically focus on problems associated with big bureaucracy that drive the locus of control away from the operational setting; the loss of local control over programs and practices; notions that such arrangements do not necessarily guarantee efficiency when allocating resources&mdash;that is, some areas could finance local programs more generously than if one bigger budget was spread across many regions&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p class="tx">These variations in arrangements reflect differences in interface primarily between state and local governments. There are other permutations of arrangements, particularly at the state level of government, dividing authority among agencies at that level. These are discussed in our examination of the state Department of Corrections.</p>

<a id="p39"></a>

<h2 class="h2">Departments and Divisions of Corrections</h2>
<p class="tx">Each state has a large and complex corrections organization known either as a <strong>Department of Corrections</strong> or a <strong>Division of Corrections</strong> and is part of the executive branch of government. These agencies vary in size, level of funding, structure, staffing, and more. Beyond these differences, these agencies vary in terms of their authority over and responsibility for correctional functions. These agencies have authority and responsibility for adult corrections (that is, convicted adult offenders whose sentences place them under the agency&rsquo;s authority), and some have authority and responsibility for certain juvenile efforts&mdash;in particular, the operation of juvenile institutions.</p>

<p class="tx">Forty-eight states have an autonomous executive agency, a Department of Corrections; two states maintain a Division of Corrections that is organized as a component of a larger executive agency, a Department of Human Services (American Correctional Association, 2010). The various states have arrived at different arrangements for how to distribute corrections functions at the state level. In a rational sense, any arrangement that effectively and efficiently achieves correctional aims could be deemed appropriate. However, just as there is controversy over correctional aims, so too is there controversy over how to appropriately arrange and organize correctional efforts within the states.</p>

<p class="tx">State arrangements have been determined over time, with some degree of rationality, through political interaction and accommodation. Most state arrangements have been in place for so long that they have become entrenched and would be difficult to change, even if there were questions about their effectiveness. Those who do question present arrangements tend to focus on issues such as duplication of structure, duplication of efforts, ambiguity in operationalizing goals and objectives, fragmentation of efforts, and so on. Some employ the rational logic of centralization, asking whether effectiveness and efficiency would not be better served by having a superagency that coordinates state- and local-level corrections efforts, centrally allocates resources, sets policies to dovetail efforts in unified directions, and monitors and evaluates with authority to develop and implement rational changes.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Centralization Efforts</h2>
<p class="tx">Centralizing corrections arrangements may make logical sense, but such changes require realignments that would encounter political resistance, either from other governmental agencies, interest groups concerned with the potential effects of such changes, other interested parties, or from within the agencies and organizations that would be most directly affected. Such an undertaking could mean eliminating positions, changing networks of influence and control, changing the ways of doing business, introducing scrutiny that may threaten some or many, and so on. Bringing local agencies and organizations within a centralized structure would mean changing the nature of the relationship between local and state governments, reducing local autonomy, changing the locus of control and authority, changing funding patterns, and perhaps changing staffing patterns, among other issues.</p>

<p class="tx">State operations are frequently charged with fragmentation, lack of coordination, lack of centralized leadership, and related issues. While centralization advocates may overcome resistance, and some form of centralization could occur&mdash;for example, some states have created monitoring agencies that formulate standards and have some authority to determine and induce compliance&mdash;such changes are difficult to achieve. Among the difficulties to be surmounted is the problem of showing not how the world of corrections would be different but rather how it would be improved in terms of ultimate outcomes.</p>

<p class="tx">Let us turn to a more direct examination of correctional functions. The remaining sections of this chapter cover some basic aspects of the corrections enterprise, such as prison populations, budgets, numbers of probationers and parolees, and other details.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Inmate Populations and Incarceration Rates</h2>
<p class="tx">As noted previously, incarceration is a major function for all Departments of Corrections. Table 2.2 provides demographic information for state and federal correctional populations. The Bureau of Justice Statistics indicates that data estimates prior to 2016 for race and Hispanic origin may differ due to a change in measurement methods (Carson, 2018).</p>

<p class="tx">Table 2.4 shows the number and rate of persons under state and federal correctional authorities by jurisdiction in 2016. Note that the total correctional population shown does not include the estimated number of prisoners held in jail, probationers and parolees who are in prison or jail, and parolees who are on probation (Kaeble &amp; Cowhig, 2018). The incarceration rate provides additional insight into how correctional populations are allocated across jurisdictions. As you consider the data in Table 2.4, think about the distinction between incarceration totals (in terms of the number of people in jails or prisons) and rates (in terms of the number of incarcerated per 100,000 U.S. adult residents). Think also about how or why legislation or policies may seek to address incarceration rates. For example, the total number of people in prisons or jails in Oklahoma in 2016 was 39,000, with an incarceration rate of 1,310 per 100,000 U.S. adult residents (ages 18 and older); in Tennessee this ratio was 48,400 total, with 930 per 100,000; and in Kansas it was 17,200 total with 780 per 100,000. What might account for the seeming discrepancies between the total inmate populations and the rates of incarceration both within and between these states? Information on rates may provide additional context for correctional populations relative to societal populations, beyond that offered by incarceration totals alone. </p>

<p class="tx">Comparatively speaking, the United States leads the world in adult incarceration rates. The spiraling costs associated with incarceration led one state, Minnesota, to attempt a different strategy. Beginning in the early 1970s, Minnesota embarked on a strategy to emphasize the development of more community corrections alternatives and to keep the prison population as small as possible. The state has subsidized local initiatives by directly funding local governments when a convicted offender who otherwise would be assigned to the state Department of Corrections is placed in a community alternative program. In other words, a local government receives a portion of the amount this offender would have cost the state if he or she had been incarcerated under the Department of Corrections. This serves as a financial incentive for communities to design and implement alternative programs. Over the long term, this strategy has effectively reduced the reliance on incarceration as a dominant strategy. It has kept down the prison population and costs associated with incarceration (Wisconsin Taxpayer Alliance, 2010). </p>

<h1 class="h1"><strong>Applying Criminal Justice:</strong> <em>California&rsquo;s Prison Overcrowding Dilemma</em></h1>

</div>

<p class="tx">In a landmark decision (5&ndash;4), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <em>Brown v. Plata</em> (2011) that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was operating its 33 prisons in an unconstitutional manner, largely due to massive overcrowding, a problem the department had been experiencing since the early 1990s. The court ruled that the conditions that led to the overcrowding, and the overcrowding itself, had to be remedied, setting capacity levels for prisons and a timetable to comply with the court order. The court determined that by May 2013, California&rsquo;s prisons had to be at no more than 137.5% of their design capacity. During the 20 years of litigation surrounding the overcrowding, the department had placed over 170,000 prisoners in cell space made for roughly 88,000 prisoners, operating at almost 200% capacity. During the case, federal district court judge Thelton Henderson stated that an inmate a week was dying due to the negligence and indifference of correctional officials. According to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (2015), by 2015 the state had lowered its population to 135% of its design capacity.</p>

<p class="tx">How would you address the prison overcrowding problem? As you consider the issue as raised in the <em>Brown v. Plata</em> decision, consider our discussion regarding correctional aims and what society is trying to achieve with prisons. Is it possible that none of the correctional aims we have discussed can be satisfactorily addressed when prisons are significantly overcrowded? In particular, how can offenders be rehabilitated under such difficult conditions? Does <em>Brown v. Plata</em> place other correctional systems on notice that the court will not tolerate unconstitutional conditions in prisons?</p>

<div class="p-ct">Probation is a common form of community supervision. Do you think it is an effective correctional method? Why or why not?</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">Incarceration is a major dimension of each state&rsquo;s overall corrections strategy. However, some states incarcerate a greater percentage of offenders than do others. As state governments become more resource strapped, it may become more necessary to press for greater understanding and more intense discussion of alternative strategies and options. States have moved to provide <strong>third-level alternatives</strong>, such as house arrest and use of electronic monitoring. However, it is worth noting that in most instances, the effect has been to expand the number of people under correctional authority rather than to reduce prison populations (Walker, 2011). </p>

<h2 class="h2">Community Supervision</h2>
<p class="tx">The number of adult offenders under community supervision at the close of 2016 was 4,537,100 (Kaeble &amp; Cowhig, 2018). Table 2.5 shows the rates of persons under community supervision in 2000, 2005, and 2010&ndash;2016.</p>

<p class="tx">The use of probation grew dramatically over 2 decades but has begun to steadily decline in recent years. Probation as a form of community supervision continues to be a major dimension of U.S. corrections. Table 2.6 shows the number of adults under parole and probation supervision under state and federal authority in 2016. The total number of parolees in 2016 was 874,777. The numbers in Table 2.6 reflect the total number of persons on discretionary release parole and on mandatory release extended supervision. Parole is an example of a discretionary release. <em>Mandatory release</em> means that an offender must be released from an institution because he or she has served the time required by his or her sentence. Regarding paroling authorities, keep in mind that a number of states have moved to mandatory release from discretionary release. These states and the federal government still maintain a discretionary release authority, because there are still inmates who were sentenced prior to changes in the law.</p>

<h1 class="eoc-h1" id="ch02Conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>

<p class="tx">This brief look at the federal and state systems leads us to consider the enormity of correctional undertakings in the United States. Corrections is driven by a number of aims, and sometimes those aims are in competition with one another. It is impossible to speak about corrections in the United States in terms of simple aims and structures. The issues are complex and often feature topics that have unspecified numbers of seemingly or actually incalculable variables. </p>

<p class="tx">The remainder of this book will explore corrections from different perspectives and topics. The goal is to provide you with a well-grounded understanding of the U.S. correctional system. Corrections is a complex entity, encompassing many programs, perspectives, and structures. Learning about corrections is not restricted to the content of this book, however. We hope you will think about the application of what you learn in these pages and ask further questions. You are encouraged to move beyond the concepts and ideas presented here and explore corrections at a deeper level. This may involve other readings, learning from correctional professionals, visiting a correctional facility or a community-based correctional center, or working in corrections either as an employee or volunteer.</p>

<p class="tx">Our experience&mdash;as authors who write about corrections and as people who have worked in corrections and with correctional professionals over 3 decades&mdash;is that correctional work is never boring but always challenging. As you read this book, think about how you would contribute to the correctional enterprise. Remember that correctional work ultimately deals with people, some of whom can be unpleasant or difficult. Yet at the end of the day, regardless of the correctional aim being pursued, working in corrections means having some type of impact. That impact is directly felt by others, whether it is a life changed by a correctional intervention or a society that is better protected due to offenders being placed in institutions. Corrections personnel believe that they can have an impact on crime and criminals. This effect may be minimal in some cases, but taken as a whole, corrections has a huge impact on society, the offenders placed under correctional authority, and the people who do correctional work.</p>
