<h1 class="h1" id="ch06intro">Introduction</h1>

<p class="tx">&ldquo;Administration is most often discussed as the art of getting things done&rdquo; (Simon, 1976, p. 1). In the context of prisons, administration is the process of managing a correctional organization. Indeed, correctional managers and leaders have a great deal to do. They must be concerned with leadership, planning, organizing, managing internal and external environments, decision making, budgets and fiscal management, program implementation and assessment, human resource management and development, and related areas. Correctional leaders and managers are responsible for directing correctional staff as they accomplish specific goals (Stojkovic &amp; Farkas, 2003). They are expected to maintain a safe and secure environment for both staff and inmates, to provide sanctions to offenders while also providing services that might &ldquo;correct&rdquo; their behavior, to &ldquo;do more with less&rdquo; as budgets become tighter, and to respond to both internal interests (such as the concerns of unions) and external interests (such as those of courts, legislative bodies, and others; Stojkovic &amp; Farkas, 2003).</p>

<p class="tx">This chapter explores selected aspects of correctional <strong>administration</strong>&mdash;ones we think can help develop a fundamental perspective from which to ask questions about why things happen in corrections the way they do. With this aim in mind, it is important to realize that there is a great deal of diversity among corrections organizations and their administration; yet there is also much common ground. For example, Cerrato (2014) notes that certain goals, such as stability and order, are common across all correctional institutions. </p>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec6.1">6.1&ensp;Analytical Levels for Correctional Administration</h1>

<p class="tx">In the United States corrections efforts are not centralized at the national level&mdash;there is no single, organizational pyramid with a designated center for coordinating, controlling, and allocating resources. Rather, the United States has a system of federal, state, and local corrections efforts. At each level of government, various corrections agencies&mdash;such as the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services, each of the State Departments of Corrections, local jails, locally organized probation agencies, and other local agencies&mdash;must work within different realms of jurisdiction and responsibility, respond to different external political forces, and deal with different arrangements for funding. Each state has a Department or Division of Corrections, the typical organization of which is discussed later in this chapter. This section looks at American corrections from different analytical levels of analysis, which include societal, Department of Corrections (DOC), and service delivery. Our primary interest in this discussion is to gain a clearer idea of the context(s) in which correctional organizations are administered and identify some relevant implications for administration.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Societal Level</h2>

<p class="tx">The United States is a diverse society, composed of individuals and groups who hold all different types of beliefs and opinions, many of which are often in direct conflict. Americans are also vastly different in terms of their wealth, power, and influence. Therefore, in an organizational sense, we must think about society in a broad manner as providing the &ldquo;major option-setting context&rdquo; (Perrow, 1986, p. 263) within which corrections organizations and administrators must operate. </p>

<a id="p135"></a>
<p class="tx">Although corrections has no organizational pyramid extending from the national to the local level, it is important to consider the types of forces and factors that shape policies and actions in corrections at the broadest level. At this societal level, we must consider the political, economic, and cultural conditions that affect the administration of corrections. </p>

<h3 class="h3"><em>Political Considerations</em></h3>

<p class="tx">Politically, correctional administration is shaped by the distribution of power. <strong>Power</strong> is the ability to influence or obtain compliance, either as a result of formal authority or the development of informal influence. Our governmental and social arrangements, and the ways people respond to and think about these arrangements, are crucial facets of the overall context for correctional administration.</p>

<p class="tx">In American society, power is distributed among many sets of persons at various levels of government. There are many ways to develop and apply influence and power at each level. Individuals and groups with different interests and unequal influence use a variety of techniques to ensure their interests are reflected in the policies that shape the direction of corrections. The policies that emerge are <strong>political resultants</strong> that reflect the power and influence exerted at different levels of government; Allison (1971) used this term to refer to decisions that result from bargaining among key decision makers.</p>

<p class="tx">The policies that result are developed gradually. Past decisions, policies, actions, and beliefs have great force and form the base on which current policies are argued, expressed, and implemented. Just as there is no single theory that covers all causes of crime, there is no singular approach to corrections. Those who hold different beliefs about crime&rsquo;s causes and effects, and about appropriate approaches to corrections, may participate in a complicated set of processes that direct the correctional endeavors in this nation. Those with sufficient influence tend to have their preferences expressed in policy and put into action.</p>

<p class="tx">Correctional administrators operate in a societal context characterized by controversy, competing interests, and persons and groups who have varying degrees of power. These people and groups seek to &ldquo;use&rdquo; corrections organizations to further their beliefs, visions, and interests. Because of the complexity of the U.S. government, there is the possibility for, and the actuality of, competing beliefs, visions, and interests to pull corrections in many directions. Correctional administrators must report to those who have direct control over their operations (for example, the state governor, the legislature&rsquo;s Corrections Committee or Appropriations Committee, and more) and to those who influence those who directly control their operations (for example, powerful political constituents who want a new prison sited in their community, or leaders who see a political advantage in building more prisons rather than finding community alternatives). Powerful, well-organized interests may also include correctional officer unions, among others. (See more examples later in this chapter, and consider the issues raised in the feature box, <em>Applying Criminal Justice: Unions, Budgets, and Job Concerns: Powerful Interests</em>.) Remember too that most Americans know very little about corrections, and if they engage with correctional issues at all, it is usually in general ways regarding general notions about how government operates&mdash;or they might respond to select information that is made available by those who have specific interests in government or corrections.</p>

<h1 class="h1"><strong>Applying Criminal Justice:</strong> <em>Unions, Budgets, and Job Concerns: Powerful Interests </em></h1>

<div class="photo-right">

</div>

<p class="tx">Correctional departments sometimes face sudden and unanticipated budget reductions, which may force officials to reconsider their capacity for administration and staffing. In some cases, unions may be able to powerfully respond to politically backed budget changes and other correctional administration issues.</p>

<p class="tx">In a 2012 news article, the <em>Hanford Sentinel</em> reported that in response to a bill passed by the California legislature aimed at reducing costs, leaders at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) had ordered reductions in the number of guards at Corcoran State Prison. Corcoran is a maximum security facility operated by the CDCR, and the California Correctional Peace Officers Association (CCPOA), one of the most powerful unions in California, had serious concerns regarding the reductions. </p>

<p class="tx">Leaders of the Corcoran chapter of the CCPOA were particularly concerned about potential safety issues associated with the reductions and upset that the CDCR had not responded to these concerns. The article explained the situation as follows:</p>

<p class="ext">Rene Hernandez, the chapter&rsquo;s vice president, said the major problem is the state is cutting important armed positions such as maximum security guards, compromising the safety of the public and other staff.</p>

<p class="ext">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to get state legislators to see the concerns of the staff and how many critical safety positions are being eliminated,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="ext">Hernandez said the CCPOA has tried to voice its concerns to prison administration as well as to state legislators, but have been ignored. (Luiz, 2012, para. 3)</p>

<p class="tx">The concerns presented by the Corcoran CCPOA chapter describe a confrontation between the union and CDCR administration. This union is well funded, has articulate leaders, and employs skilled attorneys. The CCPOA lobbies the California legislature and important political figures; it also tries to strategically place its members on important policy making boards and commissions to influence the CDCR.</p>

<p class="tx">Imagine you are the secretary of the CDCR, an organization with over 22,000 correctional officers. How would you envision creating a &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; from a situation like that presented here? How could your organization work with a union to address labor interests? What would be your overall strategy regarding labor relations?</p>
</div>

<h3 class="h3"><em>Economic Considerations</em></h3>

<p class="tx">Economically, the most prominent corrections-related concerns pertain to the general state of the economy and its potential impact on matters related to correctional administration. During national recessions, there are generally fewer resources available to perform government work. Conversely, times of rapid economic expansion may result in increased resources or surpluses. It is far easier, many say, to administer an agency or organization whose budget is &ldquo;fat.&rdquo; </p>

<a id="p137"></a>
<p class="tx">Resources, budgets, and operating costs are often used to frame issues pertaining to correctional administration. In general, corrections agencies must compete with all other agencies for available resources. Correctional administrators often think their organizations receive too little or less than adequate resources. </p>

<p class="tx">A significant challenge for correctional administration revolves around the fact that, looking at aggregate profiles of those funneled into the correctional system, the &ldquo;business&rdquo; of corrections largely involves correcting persons from society&rsquo;s lower socioeconomic levels. Corrections agency leaders are tasked with designing strategies, programs, policies, and actions that &ldquo;correct&rdquo; people, while being unable to do much about the environments from which offenders emerge and to which they most often must return. Corrections is often a frustrating business, in terms of whether correctional staff can achieve impact or be effective in situations in which outcomes are to a large extent dependent on social, economic, and political forces that are beyond their ability to harness or control. For example, Turkington (2017) notes that Louisiana&rsquo;s high rate of incarceration is influenced by a variety of sources, including the state&rsquo;s use of mandatory minimums, recidivism, a shortage of public defenders, and &ldquo;incentives to keep the state&rsquo;s incarceration rate high&rdquo; (p. 570). </p>

<h3 class="h3"><em>Cultural Considerations</em></h3>

<p class="tx">Culturally, we must consider the attitudes, orientations, and beliefs that predominate discussions of just what corrections is supposed to accomplish. Correctional administrators are often forced to engage in a balancing act. They are often placed in no-win situations, stemming from debates and political maneuvering over what options to pursue. They are faced with reinforcing the image of the government as acting to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; large problems in the absence of viable &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; and in situations in which policy development and implementation must often be derived from a compromise negotiated among those with competing interests and varying degrees of influence over decision makers. There are cyclical calls to &ldquo;reform&rdquo; corrections&mdash;to pursue different options. However, traditions, customs, habits, and past practices can have a very strong pull. It is often very difficult to gain widespread acceptance to pursue new or different options. The overriding political approach to corrections often features a <strong>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t hurt me&rdquo; agenda</strong>, which means that administrators make as few waves as possible, appeasing any significantly competing interests while trying to show that something constructive is underway&mdash;all while maintaining an acceptable image.</p>

<h2 class="h2">The DOC Level</h2>

<p class="tx">We have chosen to call a second level of analysis the DOC (Department or Division of Corrections) level. Our primary concern at this level is for the administrative contexts of Departments or Divisions of Corrections, which are normally structured as major elements of state government, and the large organizations established to carry out corrections efforts for the federal government (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Prisons). Few of these &ldquo;systems&rdquo; could be called centralized; that is, various state and federal corrections functions are not organized under a single administrative identity or one large agency. Nonetheless, these large, complex organizations are primary elements in the delivery of corrections services in the United States, and it is important to understand the concerns and issues related to administration at this level.</p>

<a id="p138"></a>
<p class="tx">Chapter 2 discussed variations in the structure of state and federal departments/divisions of corrections. As you read, keep those variations in mind. Figure 6.1 shows a typical DOC: a large, complex governmental organization structured to provide an array of correctional services under the authority of a state government. The state represented also has correctional services (such as probation, in its largest cities; community correctional centers; jails; and some other community-based services) organized under local government authority, but the focus of our attention is the big state agency.</p>

<div class="figure-box">
<h4 class="figure-name">Figure 6.1: Internal and external environments that affect the DOC</h4>

<p class="tx">The DOC is a complex, state-run governmental organization that must address numerous, often competing, concerns from both internal and external environments.</p>

<img src="figures/fig.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the internal and external concerns that impact the Department of Corrections. External concerns include state legislature, state governor, federal and state courts, media, interest groups, and other executive and criminal justice agencies. Internal concerns include the department of corrections, adult and juvenile institutions, and the division of community corrections, as well as the field services associated with them." title="Diagram showing the internal and external concerns that impact the Department of Corrections. External concerns include state legislature, state governor, federal and state courts, media, interest groups, and other executive and criminal justice agencies. Internal concerns include the department of corrections, adult and juvenile institutions, and the division of community corrections, as well as the field services associated with them." class="figure" id="fig_6.1" />
</div>

<p class="tx">In terms of its organization, the DOC has an <strong>internal environment</strong> (the composite of formal and informal aspects within the organization). We will further discuss the internal environment of corrections organizations in upcoming sections on common concerns and institutional management. For now, it is important to note that the DOC is highly differentiated, it has several major subdivisions, and many of its members work in specialized subunits. In effect, the issues, problems, and tasks the DOC must address and carry out are subdivided, and its structure reflects this. </p>

<h3 class="h3"><em>Organizational Interests</em></h3>

<p class="tx">Those who manage and work within each major subcomponent and specialized subunit tend to concentrate on their own portion of the organization and to selectively prioritize their roles, their share of the overall problems, and their organizational interests as the most important.</p>

<a id="p139"></a>
<p class="tx">Top-level management must ensure that the entire organization functions as a well-integrated entity. As might be expected, many difficulties stem from having a differentiated structure. Top-level management must allocate resources for the entire organization, often using a limited budget. At budgeting time, those in charge of administering the major subcomponents and specialized subunits often compete with each other for slices of the budget pie, and budget maneuvering can cause organizational tension. Top-level management is ultimately accountable for distributing resources throughout the organization, and difficult decisions must be made about internal issues that rarely satisfy all those concerned. Similar difficulties emerge when trying to coordinate and control the operations of the DOC. </p>

<h3 class="h3"><em>Different Locations</em></h3>

<p class="tx">The DOC&rsquo;s subelements are physically located across the state. Their operations do not take place in a vacuum, and they are subject to the influences of their immediate environments. This makes controlling and coordinating the organization a very complicated undertaking. Consider a probation field office operating in a particular city. This office must establish working relationships with nearby law enforcement agencies, courts, district attorneys&rsquo; offices, and more. These relationships may include both formal and informal working agreements that require the cooperation of all who are involved.</p>

<p class="tx">Top-level management may issue general policies to guide the field office&rsquo;s operation, but lower level managers are usually tasked with executing such policies and dealing with the details of day-to-day operations. In addition, field offices across the state will encounter various situations. Even this cursory illustration should help us begin to understand the delegation of <strong>authority</strong> (the legitimate power inherent in a position to manage, sanction, and provide incentives) and the existence of discretion at all levels of management. These are important aspects of the internal environment. Coordinating and controlling such a large agency is difficult, and considering the many aspects of DOC operation (budgeting, personnel decisions, task accomplishment, etc.), administration is neither simple nor easy.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><em>The External Environment</em></h3>

<p class="tx">DOC administrators must also confront the <strong>external environment</strong>, which encompasses the significant forces outside the organization that affect its operation. Most top-level correctional administrators recognize that they operate in very political contexts. As important and time-consuming as their activities are in terms of confronting and resolving the organization&rsquo;s internal issues and problems regarding its day-to-day functioning and the accomplishment of tasks, most top-level managers are primarily focused on interacting with significant people in the external environment. At the system (department or division) level, there are numerous significant relationships to be maintained with other organizations, groups, and individuals important to the operation of the DOC. The slate of &ldquo;significant relationships&rdquo; may vary somewhat from state to state and per the issues or problems that directly involve the DOC. It is important to think about such relationships and how the external environment affects administration. It is not necessary to exhaustively list all potentially important &ldquo;significant others,&rdquo; but we offer the following as examples. </p>

<p class="tx">The DOC is an agency within the executive branch of state government. Its top administrator is appointed by the governor; therefore, the governor has significant influence over the direction of overall policy for the DOC. Here, <strong>policy</strong> means a formally expressed practice or strategy of action.</p>

<a id="p140"></a>
<p class="tx">Do not lose sight of the fact that governors are elected and respond to influential constituents; they also have many demanding responsibilities. Under one governor, a DOC might have a top administrator who has a strong corrections background and is inclined to &ldquo;do something constructive&rdquo; with offenders; under another governor, however, the top administrator may have a corporate or &ldquo;big government&rdquo; background and be primarily inclined to operate an &ldquo;efficient agency.&rdquo; It may be somewhat uncharitable to say, but many governors develop a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t hurt me&rdquo; agenda regarding the DOC&rsquo;s operation&mdash;meaning that the top administrator is expected to keep a low profile for the DOC, satisfy as many interests as possible, keep operations stable and efficient, and otherwise avoid having problems surface.</p>

<p class="tx">The state legislature is another critical player in the DOC&rsquo;s external environment. The DOC&rsquo;s budget is dependent on the action of the legislature, and top-level administrators must attempt to maintain relationships that put them in a good position to lobby for funding. Also, the legislature passes laws that directly affect the DOC&rsquo;s operations. Top-level administrators must maintain relationships that put them in a strong position to lobby for or against legislation important to them and the organization. The legislature has committees, subcommittees, and individual members (those who are particularly interested in corrections, for whatever reason) important to the DOC. The DOC&rsquo;s top-level administrators are particularly concerned with relationships with finance committees, judiciary committees, corrections committees, and individual legislators who take a keen interest in corrections&mdash;either as allies or antagonists.</p>

<div class="photo-box-right-thin">

<p class="credit">Alex Wong/Getty Images News/&#169; 2009 Getty Images</p>
<div class="p-ct">The media plays an important role in corrections administration because their coverage influences how the public views the DOC. How can an administration use the media to regulate its image?</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">Both state and federal courts are also significant to those who control the DOC. Regarding the courts, many correctional administrators view themselves as generally on the defensive, responding to litigation (and even <em>possible</em> litigation) that may arise from various sources. Consider a hypothetical DOC currently operating under a <strong>consent decree</strong>, a settlement of a lawsuit in which the administration agrees to take certain actions without admitting fault or guilt for the situation that gave rise to the suit (Oran, 1983). This decree is issued by a federal district court, stemming from a class action lawsuit filed by inmates. It should be noted that this situation is not far-fetched&mdash;almost all state DOCs have had a federal court order issued against either the entire system or one or more of the major institutions. In such a situation, the DOC&rsquo;s administrators, under a plan agreed to in court, are required to take action in a number of areas to alleviate conditions the federal judge has found unacceptable. The court will monitor progress. The DOC&rsquo;s top administrators will respond directly to ongoing inquiries made by the federal judge. In addition, other litigation is continually pending. A great deal of top management&rsquo;s energy is thus focused on maintaining a management posture and creating sets of policies and operating procedures that can provide a strong array of defensible positions to litigation.</p>

<a id="p141"></a>
<p class="tx">The media must also be recognized as an element of the external environment affecting the DOC. The media, and its various elements, are powerful: It helps set the tone for opinions of the DOC and pursues issues that can result in either criticism of or favorable publicity about the DOC and its administration. The DOC&rsquo;s top administrators are concerned with <strong>image management</strong>&mdash;the process of designing and controlling an organization&rsquo;s representation, which involves policies and procedures regarding interactions with media personnel and the release of information. Controlling image management is difficult given the organization&rsquo;s size, and the fact that its subelements and personnel are spread throughout the state, offering many points of potential access and interaction. </p>

<p class="tx">The general public is also an important part of the external environment. After all, tax dollars support the organization, and the &ldquo;public&rdquo; may quite rightfully be termed the &ldquo;clients&rdquo; (or purchasers) of the services the DOC provides. However, as noted earlier, the public is composed of individuals and groups that have and advocate for diverse interests and opinions and have varying degrees of access to and influence over important decision makers.</p>

<p class="tx">There are a variety of <strong>interest groups</strong> within the external environment. These are organized groups of people who want their preferences expressed in policies or actions&mdash;in this case those that pertain to corrections organizations.</p>

<p class="tx">Examples of potentially important external interest groups are</p>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">inmate rights groups;</li>
<li class="bl">various reform groups (e.g., neo-retributionist reformers);</li>
<li class="bl">professional groups with vested interests (e.g., the American Correctional Association);</li>
<li class="bl">unions (e.g., correctional officer unions);</li>
<li class="bl">community interest groups (e.g., those seeking or opposing the location of a particular prison); and</li>
<li class="bl">private-sector interest groups (e.g., those interested in vendor contracts, private sector financing arrangements, or institutional facility management contracts).</li>
</ul>

<p class="tx">The external environment may also produce technologies that inform aspects of correctional administration. Bargaric, Hunter, and Wolf (2018) explore how emerging technologies could be used as substitutes for incarceration, which could potentially reduce the number of prisons and alter how correction is administered.</p>

<p class="tx">Top-level DOC managers must interact with those seeking to influence the organization&rsquo;s operation. Often, these external &ldquo;significant others&rdquo; are quite powerful and have a broad base of political support. However, many external groups are relatively underpowered; that is, they may act in &ldquo;good conscience&rdquo; but have not amassed the power or support to swing a great deal of weight. The difficulty for top management lies in determining to whom to respond, and how. Occasionally, top management may wish to use external interest groups to further its own aims. In this case, management issues center on developing and maintaining alliances that are considered critical for the organization&rsquo;s support and management&rsquo;s perceptions of the DOC&rsquo;s interests.</p>

<div class="video-right">
<p class="video-head">Partisan Support for &quot;Three Strikes&quot; Initiative</p>
<div class="video-caption">Many agenda interacted over supporting the "Three Strikes" initiative. Large financial supporters included the California Republican Party, Mike Huffington, the NRA, and the prison guards union. The "Three Strikes" initiative in California clearly demonstrates the influence of external environments. How did the passing of the "Three Strikes" legislation affect the operation of the California Department of Corrections?</div>

<a id="p142"></a>
<p class="tx">Beyond this, the DOC&rsquo;s external environment includes several other organizations important to its operation. Other criminal justice organizations are important in the sense that they provide a larger process, of which the DOC is a part. Policies (such as sentencing changes) are important to the DOC and its leadership. The DOC&rsquo;s administrators must stay aware of potential shifts and may need to provide input on other organizations&rsquo; policies.</p>

<p class="tx">Other government agencies, such as a Department of Administration, or Management and Budget, are also important. The DOC&rsquo;s administrators must comply with the policies and procedures of outside agencies when resulting actions affect the DOC. Again, the DOC&rsquo;s top managers may need to have input concerning the development of policies and procedures that affect them; they also may need to establish and maintain good working relationships with the administrators of other agencies to help facilitate the DOC&rsquo;s smooth operation as a part of the larger network of government organizations.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Service-Delivery Level</h2>

<p class="tx">The service-delivery level includes single organizations that are directly involved with corrections-related operational activities&mdash;these include correctional institutions, probation field offices, and other organizations established to provide various correctional programs. These organizations may be component parts of DOCs, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or any one of the organizations established and controlled through a local government (i.e., that serve limited areas and populations). Correctional administration can also include indirect government delivery of services, which &ldquo;combines the authority, legitimacy, and resources of the government with the management capabilities of more flexible and theoretically more cost efficient private sector entities&rdquo; (Ferrandino, 2017, p. 55). The privatization of corrections is explored further in Chapter 10. An extensive list of the many facilities associated with the Federal Bureau of Prisons can be found at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.bop.gov/about/facilities/">https://www.bop.gov/about/facilities/</a>. As you review this list, think about how various facilities in the Federal Bureau of Prisons contribute to correctional operations.</p>

<p class="tx">Earlier, we used the term <em>system</em> to refer to the DOCs. In the terminology of organizational theory, <em>system</em> can refer to a large, multifaceted organization such as a DOC; to a smaller, single organization and its component parts; or to any of the component parts analyzed unto themselves. In other words, a correctional institution may be viewed as an organizational system with an internal and external environment, in the same way we viewed the DOC as a system.</p>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec6.2">6.2&ensp;Bureaucracy in Corrections Organizations</h1>

<p class="tx">Whether we are considering a DOC, a prison, a probation field office, or a particular program-delivery organization, corrections organizations should be understood as complex, bureaucratic organizations. Corrections organizations are not unique in this sense; that is, government organizations, and most private sector organizations, may be generally characterized in the same way.</p>

<p class="tx"><strong>Bureaucracy</strong> refers to a ubiquitous organizational form, characterized by hierarchy of authority, written rules and procedures, specialization, and expertise. Most of society&rsquo;s organizations are to a large degree bureaucratic. Their structures and activities are based on the following:</p>

<a id="p143"></a>
<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">a division of labor, </li>
<li class="bl">a multilevel formal structure with a hierarchy of positions or offices,</li>
<li class="bl">dependence on formal rules and procedures to ensure uniformity and to regulate the behavior of job holders,</li>
<li class="bl">an impersonal nature,</li>
<li class="bl">employment decisions based on merit,</li>
<li class="bl">career tracks established to allow for advancement and secure commitment of employees, and</li>
<li class="bl">supposedly the separation of the organization member&rsquo;s work affairs and his or her personal affairs. (Robbins, 1987, p. 233)</li>
</ul>

<p class="tx">These characteristics illustrate the classical perspective on organization proposed by Max Weber in 1947. They illustrate &ldquo;Weber&rsquo;s &lsquo;ideal&rsquo; type of rational [goal-oriented] and efficient organization&rdquo; (Robbins, 1987, p. 233). An investigation into any corrections organization will reveal formal design features that to a large extent reflect the above characteristics. However, it is important to note that the Weber &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; is just that. It is not a factual description of how most organizations operate (Robbins, 1987). When considering the internal environments of a corrections organization, we find the formal frameworks to be bureaucratic, both in terms of their structure and expected behaviors. Nonetheless, the operation and administration of these organizations does not necessarily match the ideal in all respects.</p>

<div class="p-ct">Bureaucracy is a key part of the corrections system. Here, Mississippi&#39;s corrections commissioner addresses members of the House Corrections and Judiciary Committees. Why is bureaucracy necessary in correctional organizations?</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">As an organizational design, bureaucracy has many strong and positive qualities. For example, at the very least, lines of formal authority and accountability, duties, and responsibilities are specified and made clear. <strong>Standardization</strong>&mdash;the consistency in operations resulting from the use of rules and procedures for recurring situations or aspects of operation&mdash;is the central theme of bureaucracy, and the various mechanisms associated with standardizing operations help coordinate and control the activities of large numbers of people.</p>

<p class="tx">On the other hand, the bureaucratic form itself can give rise to many organizational dysfunctions. For example, rules and regulations can become more important than the ends they are designed to achieve, employees may become alienated by the impersonality inherent in bureaucratic design, and there may be impediments to adaptation or change that stem from the effort to standardize and regulate behaviors by developing routines and repertoires of action (Robbins, 1987; Rainey, 2009; Bibas, 2017). These are among the many criticisms of bureaucracy as an organizational form.</p>

<a id="p144"></a>
<p class="tx"> The formal foundation for corrections organizations is bureaucratic. This foundation in part shapes the context within which correctional administrators operate. However, there is more to consider in thinking about the internal environment and administration. Notably, there is an informal dimension to life in complex organizations. Patterns and networks of communication, influence, and power, along with norms and expectations concerning work group performance and behaviors, are among the many aspects of administration and operation that arise as informal facets of organizational life that get overlaid and intertwined with the formal design. The informal may supplement, complement, or compete with the formal. Correctional administrators must attempt to live with, understand, confront, utilize, and perhaps even change the formal and informal dimensions of their organizations.</p>

<h1 class="h1" id="sec6.3">6.3&ensp;Management Issues for Administrators</h1>

<div class="photo-right">
<img id="img6.4" class="scaled" alt="Different managerial members along the correctional hierarchy meet to address common concerns." title="Different managerial members along the correctional hierarchy meet to address common concerns." src="images/landscape.jpg" />
<p class="credit">Kevin G. Gilbert/Herald-Mail/Associated Press</p>
<div class="p-ct">Management is an important role that exists at every level of a bureaucracy. How do the roles of managers along a hierarchy work together to benefit correctional policies?</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">The generic functions of management include planning, organizing, leading, and controlling (Robbins, 1984; Rainey, 2009). We have noted that corrections organizations are bureaucratic and hierarchical. In other words, management positions exist at various levels of these organizations. If we refer to the DOC example, we see that there is a top level of management for the entire organization, another level at the major subdivision level, and another at the single subunit level (for example, each prison has a warden or superintendent and deputy wardens or deputy superintendents, and each probation field office has a chief probation officer and perhaps a deputy chief probation officer). Within each subunit organization are levels of management (from the subunit&rsquo;s top managers, such as wardens and deputy wardens, through supervisors, such as shift supervisors or living unit managers). Some organizations have more levels of hierarchy (more levels of management) than others. </p>

<p class="tx">It is important to think in a broad sense about what managers at different levels do. They all make decisions, as well as plan, organize, lead, and control (Robbins, 1984). But as we move from an organization&rsquo;s lower, <em>operational</em> levels (where service-delivery tasks are carried out by line workers) to its upper, <em>policy-oriented</em> levels, there are differences in terms of the nature of problems that arise, what managers need to focus on, and the nature and scope of the management functions performed. Supervisors are most likely to be concerned with technical problems associated with carrying out specific sets of tasks on a day-to-day basis. Their management activities tend to primarily involve leading or controlling by directly supervising line employees. Upper level managers are most likely to be concerned with problems or issues that often are not well defined, that involve a large number of interested parties, and that primarily involve resolving questions of value or preference in selecting and organizing options to pursue. As our focus moves from middle-level management to top-level management, we would expect to see managers devoting more time to planning and resolving very broad issues, as well as organizing to pursue the appropriate options, and less time directly leading and controlling the activities of subordinates.</p>

<a id="p145"></a>
<h2 class="h2">Decision Making and Context</h2>

<p class="tx">When it comes to making decisions in the field of corrections, it is again important to consider context. We have already discussed how the external context for decision making is political; the same is true for the context of the internal environment. As noted, those in various subdivisions normally prioritize their own subdivision&rsquo;s interests. Moreover, different individuals and groups throughout the organization may think their own individual or group interests are most essential, and these interests may not coincide with management&rsquo;s perceptions of the organization&rsquo;s best interests. Beyond this, the development of informal networks of influence, communication, and power within the organization overlap formal groupings.</p>

<p class="tx">In their decision-making activities, correctional administrators engage in a process characterized by bureaucratic politics (Allison, 1971). Particularly at the middle and upper levels of management, most decisions may be described as political resultants </p>

<p class="ext">in the sense that what happens is not chosen as a [rational] solution to a problem but rather results from compromise, conflict, and confusion of officials with diverse interests and unequal influence; political in the sense that the activity from which decisions and actions emerge is best characterized as bargaining along regularized chan nels. (Allison, 1971, p. 162)</p>

<p class="tx">Consider the development of a policy, such as an organization&rsquo;s budget, which is the resultant of a set of decisions concerning the allocation of its financial resources. Inside the organization, in its internal environment, everyone will be affected by these decisions, and many will try to influence them. Certain managers, by virtue of their position, will participate directly in the decision-making process; their positions place them in formal networks or lines of authority, giving them formal responsibility for budget decisions or for input regarding these. Others may seek to influence those directly involved, either using formal communication channels or informal lines of influence. &ldquo;Power,&rdquo; formally or informally, is a blend of (a) &ldquo;bargaining advantages,&rdquo; (b) &ldquo;skill and will in using bargaining advantages,&rdquo; and (c) &ldquo;others&rsquo; perceptions of the bargaining advantages&rdquo; (Allison, 1971, p. 168) available to anyone who participates in the process.</p>

<p class="tx">This means that those with interests in the budget seek to sway the most influential decision makers, and the influential decision makers seek to influence one another. There may be many permutations of interests and interested parties. To put it in simple terms, consider a top-level administrator who wishes to increase the number and quality of programs offered to inmates. Imagine that the correctional officer force is unionized, is strong, and has a primary interest in receiving pay increases, having job security (both in the sense of job tenure and in terms of working in a physically secure environment), and increasing the number of correctional officer positions. Imagine that those with professional interests in various programs (e.g., inmate education or therapeutic programs) are seeking increases in funding, staffing, and programming. Imagine that there is a limited projected increase in monies available for salaries and positions&mdash;one item in the overall budget.</p>

<p class="tx">The correctional officer union has bargaining advantages tied to its strength in numbers, its connections to decision makers inside the organization who favor the union&rsquo;s position, and its external connections to influential lobbyists and others. Those with an interest in securing funding for programs have similar advantages. Although they may not speak with as singular a voice as the union, they may present support from externally organized professional associations, have several administrators in favor of their position, and for the purposes of our example, may represent inmates&rsquo; desire for more programs.</p>

<a id="p146"></a>
<p class="tx">Add to this the maneuvering of significant others outside the organization and we can imagine the intense debate among those who must reach a resultant decision. The overall budget decision process may involve many such difficult issues, and ultimately it may be necessary to compromise&mdash;or it may be that those with sufficient bargaining advantages may prevail in having the policy reflect their interests. </p>

<p class="tx">These types of complex problems are continually emerging in corrections organizations, and management must confront many such problems simultaneously. Many of the problems will have deadlines by which they must be solved, and thus management will focus its attention on meeting those deadlines, presenting &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; decisions, and designing or providing incentives and controls that encourage those tasked with carrying out the corresponding actions to conform with the effort.</p>

<p class="tx">Correctional administrators&rsquo; legitimacy largely depends on maintaining fairly stable organizations that achieve something (or at least appear to). Do not disregard &ldquo;bureaucratic politics&rdquo; as necessarily negative. Rather, consider that the extent to which formal and informal interactions involve the internal and external environment is an important factor in why things happen the way they do in corrections.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Focus on Institutional Management</h2>

<p class="tx">Much of the research on correctional administration has emphasized the management of maximum security correctional institutions. In this section we use the administration of a maximum security institution to analyze management at the service-delivery level. Keep in mind that correctional facility census data (2005) shows that approximately 20% of the confinement facilities in the United States are maximum security institutions. Furthermore, they house approximately 33% of all inmates (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2005). The average size of the inmate population in these institutions is just over 1,000 (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2005). Also keep in mind that there is significant variability among confinement facilities, particularly if we consider all institutions, from maximum to minimum security. Nonetheless, correctional institutions have enough in common in terms of administration that we can extend our analysis across institution types.</p>

<p class="tx">Consider a typical maximum security prison&mdash;Waupun Correctional Institution in Wisconsin (see Figure 6.2). Information about the prison is available at the Wisconsin Department of Corrections website (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://doc.wi.gov/Pages/Home.aspx">https://doc.wi.gov/</a>). Like most correctional institutions in the United States, Waupun Correctional is located in a small, rural community. As of April 2018, its inmate population was approximately 1,258. From July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, the average daily cost to incarcerate each inmate was $102.30 (State of Wisconsin Department of Corrections, 2017). The prison is a rather large, complex, bureaucratic organization with a differentiated structure&mdash;there are major divisions for custody, program services, and management operations, each of which is subdivided into a number of sections with several specialized subelements (see Figure 6.2). As of June 2017, Waupun Correctional had a total staff of approximately 445, with administrative positions extending from superintendent to line supervisor. </p>

<a id="p147"></a>
<div class="figure-box">
<h4 class="figure-name">Figure 6.2: Internal and external environments affecting Waupun Correctional Institution</h4>

<p class="tx">As is the case for the DOC and other large, maximum security prisons in the United States, administrators at Waupun Correctional Institution must contend with numerous influences from both internal and external environments.</p>

<img src="figures/fig.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the internal and external concerns that impact the Waupun Correctional Institution. The external concerns include DOC administration, state and local government, organizers of correctional officer labor unions, vendors, courts, interest groups, and media. Internal concerns include superintendent, custody, program services, business management, representative of correctional officer labor unions, and inmates." title="Diagram showing the internal and external concerns that impact the Waupun Correctional Institution. The external concerns include DOC administration, state and local government, organizers of correctional officer labor unions, vendors, courts, interest groups, and media. Internal concerns include superintendent, custody, program services, business management, representative of correctional officer labor unions, and inmates." class="figure" id="fig_6.2" />
</div>

<p class="tx">As a complex organization, Waupun Correctional Institution may be said to have both an internal environment and an external environment (remember our previous discussion of the DOC and see Figure 6.1). Correctional institution managers must be aware of an array of influences or forces in both the external environment and internal environment. In this regard, the administration of a correctional institution takes place in a very complex context.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><em>External Concerns</em></h3>

<p class="tx">Correctional institutions like Waupun are a part of a larger organization; in this case, the Wisconsin DOC. The institution must operate within the parameters and policies established by the DOC&rsquo;s top management. The superintendents of correctional institutions are granted much freedom in setting institutional policies, depending on the degree of control their upper level DOC management deems necessary. In general, wardens or superintendents have a relatively high degree of autonomy. However, these administrators remain accountable to other administrators, such as the director of adult institutions and the DOC&rsquo;s chief executive.</p>

<a id="p148"></a>
<p class="tx">In addition, Waupun Correctional is situated in a small, rural community. The prison is a major local industry and, similar to an auto plant or other factory, supports many jobs in the area. As of June 30, 2017, Waupun Correctional had an annual operating budget of over $46 million (State of Wisconsin Department of Corrections, 2017) and each year maintains a multimillion-dollar payroll. The prison&rsquo;s operation depends on numerous contracts with local vendors (e.g., food service and maintenance contracts). Local community leaders are interested in the operation of Waupun Correctional. They are likely to initiate interactions with the superintendent or other upper level managers concerning the prison&rsquo;s economic potential. Also, local leaders may initiate interactions regarding community protection or even on issues associated with better understanding the prison and its operations.</p>

<p class="tx">Waupun&rsquo;s superintendent must also interact with individuals and groups that are interested in this particular prison because of its inmates. The superintendent and other upper level managers may interface with inmate rights&rsquo; groups, their families (regarding issues such as visitation), and court officials (particularly when litigation specific to the institution is underway). Beyond this, the prison&rsquo;s administrators may interact sporadically with other interested parties, such as researchers who want to enter the prison to carry out various projects, state legislators who have special interest in its operation, and members of the media. Media attention and interest may range from sporadic to continuous. Journalism regarding prisons involves topics such as escape, prison conditions and deaths, AIDS, and debates regarding punishment versus rehabilitation. Therefore, the prison&rsquo;s administration must be sensitive to the fact that media might be interested in the prison, and the administration should be aware of any interactions between media and staff or inmates. In fact, many DOCs have a communications office that responds to news items and issues press releases related to correctional activities. For example, Waupun Correctional&rsquo;s media interactions are handled by the Wisconsin DOC&rsquo;s Communications Office (<a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://doc.wi.gov/Pages/AboutDOC/CommunicationsOffice.aspx">https://doc.wi.gov/Pages/AboutDOC/CommunicationsOffice.aspx</a>). </p>

<p class="credit">Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press</p>
<div class="p-ct">Assuring that inmates have access to recreation time is one of many internal concerns administration must consider. What concerns might administrators regard as more important than others?</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">As a final example of a significant external interest, consider that Waupun Correctional&rsquo;s officer force is unionized. The union is organized outside the institution and reflects interests of a constituency much larger than its members who work in the prison. The upper level managers must understand the labor contract and be prepared to interact with union representatives. Such interactions are particularly important&mdash;even though this interest group is externally organized, many of its members work inside the institution (are a part of its internal environment as correctional officers) and are vital to its functioning.</p>

<p class="tx">Administrators must realize the nature of the external environment and develop an understanding of the degree to which such forces may affect the institution. These administrators cannot hope to control all these forces, but they may seek to shape the environment through interactions designed to maximize favorable relationships between those connected to the institution and external parties with interest in it.</p>

<a id="p149"></a>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Internal Concerns</em></h3>

<p class="tx">Waupun Correctional has a differentiated internal environment and presents complex issues for administration (see Figure 6.2). Moreover, managing the prison requires coordinating and controlling diverse work groups (administrative personnel, correctional officers, program services personnel) and the inmate population. Administrators must plan for and manage operations in a variety of areas, some of which are listed here (adapted from McGee, 1981, pp. 76&ndash;77):</p>

<p class="tx">Waupun Correctional also offers several rehabilitative programs, including anger management, coping skills, prerelease modules, Thinking for a Change, a behavioral health unit, building maintenance and construction, and correspondence courses (Wisconsin Department of Corrections, 2017). </p>

<p class="tx">We noted earlier that standardization is a central feature of bureaucratic organization. Rules, regulations, standard operating procedures, and routines provide a formal basis for much of what needs to be done. Together with the formal system of hierarchy and authority, these help coordinate and control the work of the institution. Waupun Correctional is typical of other institutions in that it is bureaucratized&mdash;it has several levels of hierarchy and has myriad policies, rules, and regulations.</p>

<a id="p150"></a>
<p class="tx">Formal operation arrangements are often complemented and sometimes circumvented by informal expectations, informal policies, interpretations and use of discretion, and informal routines that develop over time. Formal expressions (e.g., policies and rules) are not always appropriate for and do not always cover every situation, which can mean those involved must interpret the situation and use their discretion. At times, formal authority associated with a person&rsquo;s position gives way to informal forms of power (such as wielding the ability of an expert to influence others, being a force of personality, or using certain bargaining advantages).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><em>Formal and Informal Concerns</em></h3>

<p class="tx">From an administrative point of view, managing the institution is largely a matter of recognizing and utilizing the formal and informal aspects present in the organizational context. This is not simple. The <strong>formal organization</strong> refers to the explicit aspects of an organization, including its rules and policies, structure, positions, authority, and channels of communication. The <strong>informal organization</strong> refers to patterns of behavior, interaction, and power that arise from personal association in an organization beyond the explicit formal arrangements.</p>

<p class="tx">The formal and the informal come together in practically all of the institution&rsquo;s activities. Think again about authority and power. Authority, as we have defined it, is formally present in the hierarchy of institutional positions. Most people probably conceive of the institution as controlled through the formal organizational authoritative pyramid&mdash;in other words, having a superintendent who issues broad orders or directives that are clarified and embellished as needed at the middle levels of management, then having first-line supervisors who present the ultimate orders to line personnel, who apply them in their areas of operation. This conception describes the essential notion for operation. It also describes a bureaucratic conception of &ldquo;total power,&rdquo; in that it is expected that the power to reward or sanction will account for task accomplishment and control. Those lower in the organizational pyramid are usually regarded as responsible for obeying those in positions of authority.</p>

<p class="tx">However, maintaining an institution&rsquo;s control or equilibrium is not adequately described by the above. The distribution of power does not simply coincide with the lines of formal authority. Rather, power is distributed in a polycentric manner, across many centers of control. At the very least, we must recognize that the institution&rsquo;s management and staff are concerned with controlling a large inmate population (management and staff are far outnumbered). This inmate population has no absolute duty to obey those with formal organizational authority (Sykes, 1958). Moreover, the inmate population is not composed of a single-minded group of persons. The inmate subculture is differentiated, and power and influence within this subculture are distributed in a polycentric manner. Controlling the inmate population involves a complicated blend of formal authority and informal influence, power that is shared or distributed among those in management, staff, and inmate groupings.</p>

<a id="p151"></a>
<p class="tx">We must also recognize that management is differentiated, at least by level and across divisions. Managers in the institution are not necessarily of a single mind regarding the institution&rsquo;s operation and which tasks are most important, which activities should take priority, and which approaches might result in acceptable outcomes. Staff are also differentiated and represent different interests or at least different perspectives on the institution&rsquo;s operation and their own roles within it. Consider differences such as those between program service personnel and the correctional officer force, as well as those within these nominal groupings. Think about the different potential roles, aims, perspectives, and interests within the officer force. While overall the correctional officer union from our example may present a rather singular perspective when negotiating with management, the correctional officers may themselves present a broad set of concerns regarding the institution&rsquo;s operation. This may be more apparent when we think about the activities, task assignments, and possible aims of cell block officers, those working in administrative assignments, work detail officers, yard officers, and so on. Roles within an administration may vary in part due to the focal points of persons in such roles, and even those in the same role may hold different perspectives on how the institution should be operated (Ricks &amp; Eno Louden, 2015).</p>

<p class="tx">It is critical to realize that informal aspects of organization and power may complement, supplement, and circumvent the formal aspects. We must be aware of the numerous concerns involved with the management and operation of an institution. Maintaining equilibrium or stability&mdash;control of the institution&mdash;is a primary aim. Doing so requires careful balance among many factors, especially managing a give-and-take relationship among the various work groups and between the inmates and staff.</p>

<p class="tx">If we conceive of stability as a primary outcome, then we may think of the various factors that affect power as variables in an equation. Changes in the balance of these factors&mdash;these variables&mdash;may result in changes in the balance of power and affect stability. Successful administrators understand this and carefully consider the balance of any given institution. Successfully maintaining stability while also accomplishing something constructive requires those who manage institutions to possess technical proficiency, conceptual ability, and well-developed social skills. Successful administrators understand an institution&rsquo;s polycentric distribution of power, as well as the nature and effects of external forces that impact this distribution.</p>

<h1 class="h1" id="sec6.4">6.4&ensp;A Changing Landscape for Correctional Administration: Special Populations</h1>

<p class="tx">Over the past 3 decades, the landscape for correctional administration has been changing, particularly with regard to special inmate populations. In states with three-strikes laws and where the law allows life sentences without chance of early release or parole, populations of elderly inmates are growing and constitute one such special population group. Some states, as well as the Federal Bureau of Prisons, have increased the use of security housing units (SHUs) for inmates who are designated as dangerous, creating a different type of special population. (See the scenario in the feature box <em>Applying Criminal Justice: Managing the SHU</em>.)</p>

<p class="tx">In some prison systems, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C have created special populations that require special attention (Stojkovic, 2005; Iroh, Mayo, &amp; Nijhawan, 2018). Concerns for the provision of mental health services have drawn the attention of the courts, and some prisons, even entire systems, have responded to far-reaching court orders to deal with mental health issues. </p>

<p class="tx">The following have become other specialized areas of concern for correctional administration (Stojkovic, 2005):</p>

<a id="p152"></a>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">treating chronic diseases, such as tuberculosis, asthma, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy</li>
<li class="bl">treating depression</li>

<p class="credit">Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press</p>
<div class="p-ct">The number of elderly inmates in prisons is increasing, as is the cost of maintaining them. What can be done to address issues related to managing this special population?</div>
</div>
<p class="tx">Special populations will continue to demand attention from correctional administrators. According to Stojkovic (2005):</p>



<p class="ext">These special population prisoners are often unable to be effectively managed and supervised by correctional staff in traditional ways. Instead, the effective management of special population prisoners requires either new or innovative approaches or modification and alteration to existing policies and procedures. (p. xv)</p>

<p class="tx">Additionally, Blanck (2017) explores services, risks, and legislation associated with managing offenders with physical challenges and/or special needs. Correctional administrators must prepare for all such challenges.</p>

<div class="box-2">
<h1 class="h1"><strong>Applying Criminal Justice:</strong> <em>Managing the SHU</em></h1>

<p class="tx">The following discussion is adapted from McGrath and Lovell, 2005.</p>

<p class="tx">SHUs were created to remove violent and disruptive inmates from general prison populations so that other inmates would not have to fear victimization (18&ndash;2). SHU units come in different shapes and physical plant designs (18&ndash;2). They are specifically intended to isolate designated inmates (18&ndash;2&ndash;18&ndash;3). The CDCR has two types of SHU placements. The first is a &ldquo;determinate&rdquo; placement. Inmates may be placed in an SHU for specific misconduct or criminal behavior for a time period lasting from 2 months to 6 years (18&ndash;3). The second is an &ldquo;indeterminate placement.&rdquo; Inmates may be placed in an SHU for an indeterminate time as the result of a pattern of misconduct/criminal behavior involving multiple violations (18&ndash;3). &ldquo;These placements are reviewed on a semiannual basis to evaluate the need for continued SHU placement&rdquo; (18&ndash;3). Inmates who are violent and disruptive and who have been validated as having gang affiliations may be placed in an SHU for an indeterminate time period (18&ndash;3). Gang members in an SHU must complete a 6-year period without evidence of continued gang activity to be designated &quot;inactive&quot; and be released from the SHU. Gang members may &quot;defect&quot; or dissociate themselves from the gang by completing a rigorous process. Any who complete this process may be considered for release from the SHU (18&ndash;4).</p>

<a id="p153"></a>
<p class="tx">Correctional administration covers a broad set of issues. It is useful to analyze correctional administration from different levels and perspectives, focusing on the relevant administrative implications at each level. Correctional organizations vary significantly in terms of their size, budget, structure, degree of bureaucratic complexity, and scope and nature of operations. It is important to consider the societal level of analysis and identify concerns associated with the &ldquo;major option-setting context&rdquo; (Perrow, 1986, p. 263). At this level, attention is directed toward the overall development of aims and policies.</p>

<p class="tx">Consider the California SHU (a fact sheet with additional information on SHUs can be found at <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/STG/docs/Fact%20Sheet-SHU%20with%20photos.pdf">https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/STG/docs/Fact%20Sheet-SHU%20with%20photos.pdf</a>). Inmates may be in isolation for very long periods. These inmates are placed in this situation for being violent and disruptive, and the procedures for placing them there are explicitly detailed. There are many concerns for administrators regarding management of inmates and SHU placements (see McGrath and Lovell, 2005, for a full discussion). Consider this statement:</p>

<p class="ext">It is absolutely imperative that everyone be clear that inmates are human beings, and the job is to keep them safe, provide for their physical needs, and provide them an opportunity to change and grow. While individual choices made by inmates may limit their privileges, we are not in the punishment business. (18&ndash;6)</p>

<p class="tx">If you were the administrator of an SHU, what values would you want to instill in the SHU staff? Remember the inmates are violent and disruptive and are placed there to isolate them from the general population. What would be your approach? Under conditions of isolation, how would you envision providing the opportunity to change and grow?</p>

<h1 class="eoc-h1" id="ch06Conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>

<p class="tx">Correctional administration covers a broad set of issues. It is useful to analyze correctional administration from different levels and perspectives, focusing on the relevant administrative implications at each level. Correctional organizations vary significantly in terms of their size, budget, structure, degree of bureaucratic complexity, and scope and nature of operations. It is important to consider the societal level of analysis and identify concerns associated with the &ldquo;major option-setting context&rdquo; (Perrow, 1986, p. 263). At this level, attention is directed toward the overall development of aims and policies.</p>

<p class="tx">At a second level, which we have termed the DOC level, attention is directed toward large, complex organizations, such as the Departments or Divisions of Corrections and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Here, the relationships of these organizations to significant others in an external environment, or operating context, deserve attention. In addition, administrators need to appreciate a complex internal environment that may be characterized by bureaucratic politics, as described by Allison (1971).</p>

<p class="tx">At the service-delivery level, we focus on organizations of various sorts directly involved in providing correctional services. These may be state government agencies, locally organized and administered organizations, or those that carry out broad or limited correctional functions. Attention at this level is directed toward managing complex internal structures and environments while appreciating the external contexts and operational and administrative requirements.</p>

<a id="p154"></a>
<p class="tx">Correctional administrators face many challenges, including budgeting concerns and emerging issues associated with special populations. Many correctional administrators feel intense pressure to &ldquo;do something positive&rdquo; while balancing the demands of a vast array of both internal and external entities. This chapter is a basic foundation to developing an understanding of the complexities facing administrators in corrections.</p>

<h2 class="eoc-h2">Key Ideas</h2>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl"><em>Administration</em> as used in this chapter refers to managing organizations, specifically correctional organizations.</li>
<li class="bl">Three levels of analysis are useful for understanding administration and corrections: the societal, DOC, and service-delivery levels.</li>
<li class="bl">It is important to understand political, economic, and cultural considerations at the societal level of analysis.</li>
<li class="bl">It is important to consider organizational interests, the internal and external environments, and the constellation of external interests, especially at the DOC level of&nbsp;analysis.</li>
<li class="bl">It is important to consider bureaucracy and particular management issues, including internal and external concerns, at the service-delivery level.</li>
<li class="bl">The considerations discussed at each level of analysis apply at all levels, in adapted&nbsp;forms.</li>
<li class="bl">The formal and informal aspects of organization come together in practically everything that is done in correctional organizations or by corrections personnel.</li>
<li class="bl">Special inmate populations are changing the landscape for correctional administration in the 21st century.</li>
</ul>
