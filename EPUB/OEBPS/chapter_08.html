<h1 class="h1" id="ch08intro">Introduction</h1>

<p class="tx">Of the more than 6.6 million Americans under correctional supervision at the end of 2016, nearly 3.8 million were on probation (Kaeble &amp; Cowhig, 2018). Probation services operate at federal, state, and local levels of government and involve members of more than 2,000 criminal justice agencies (Abadinsky, 2012). Though probation services extend to both adults and juveniles, this chapter focuses exclusively on adult probation.</p>

<p class="tx">The use of probation has expanded and contracted since the 1980s, largely due to its increasing costs, the rising numbers of offenders, and problems with prison overcrowding. While the early 1980s saw annual increases in the use of probation, these were short lived. The trend toward probation plateaued during the late 1980s, began to rapidly decrease in the 1990s, and has continued to decline through 2016 (Kaeble, 2018). This chapter defines probation, provides a basic understanding of its early antecedents, notes its advantages and disadvantages, and describes probation departments&rsquo; structural makeup and operations. Probation manages many more offenders than do jails and prisons, and it has been recognized as a part of the criminal justice system that for the most part works well (Lovell, 1997), even if there are questions about its effectiveness (Walker, 2011). Probation is the most visible element of community-based corrections (which were discussed in Chapter 7), and it continues to be a primary correctional response used in the 21st century.</p>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec8.1">8.1&ensp;Defining Probation</h1>

<p class="tx">Conceptually, the term <em>probation</em> refers to &ldquo;the release to the community of a person convicted of a crime so long as there is compliance with certain conditions of good behavior under the supervision of a probation officer&rdquo; (Statsky, 1985, p. 604). Probation is considered a community sentence. The <strong>probationer</strong>, the person on probation, is kept in the community, placed under certain restrictions, and often monitored by a community corrections agent (typically referred to as a probation officer). In practice, probation may closely resemble this definition or significantly depart from it.</p>

<p class="tx">Probation is a judicial function. In other words, the judiciary has legal authority both to grant probation and to revoke it or take it away. Although probation rests within the judiciary, other actors in the criminal justice process make important decisions regarding probation as well.</p>

<p class="tx">As a sentencing option, probation generally (a) suspends the execution of a sentence of incarceration, (b) suspends the imposition of a nonincarceration sentence (e.g., a fine, suspension, or other penalty), or (c) is a sentence in and of itself as imposed by a judge. This third use of probation is widely used.</p>

<p class="tx">In suspending <em>the execution</em> of a sentence of incarceration, a judge gives the offender a period of time to spend in jail or prison and then suspends all or part of this time, placing him or her on probation instead. If the offender successfully completes the terms imposed throughout the duration of the probation order, he or she avoids all or part of the incarceration. The threat of returning to incarceration serves as an incentive for the probationer to abide by the terms of probation.</p>

<a id="p185"></a>
<p class="tx">In suspending <em>the imposition</em> of a sentence, a judge defers the formal sentencing decision, placing the offender on probation for a specified period. Successfully completing the probationary term may either obviate the need to impose a sentence or be held up in favor of the offender when it comes time for sentencing. This is the least common use of probation.</p>

<p class="tx">If an offender allegedly violates probation, a <strong>revocation</strong> proceeding is held in court to determine the validity of the allegation. If the state is able to prove that the probationer did indeed violate probation, a judge has many options. The court may order the offender to complete the entire period of incarceration statutorily sanctioned for the offense. Another option is to grant the offender credit for the time spent on probation (known as <strong>street time</strong>) and order him or her to complete what remains of the originally imposed incarceration sentence. The judge can also add to the terms of probation.</p>

<p class="tx">It is common to find probation used as part of a sentencing package, combined with other forms of sentencing. For example, an offender may be sentenced to a relatively brief period of incarceration that will be followed by some time on probation&mdash;what is known as <strong>shock probation</strong> or a <strong>split sentence</strong>. Or probation may be imposed in conjunction with a <strong>fine</strong> (a dollar amount), community service (hours dedicated to the community), restitution (payment to the victim and/or the community), or other creative combinations (in which probation is usually the vehicle for ensuring compliance with the court&rsquo;s directions). Judges usually have a large degree of discretion in using probation as a sentencing option.</p>

<p class="tx">Part of probation involves an offender&rsquo;s &ldquo;conditional release to the community.&rdquo; This means that probationers are obligated to fulfill a set of <strong>general conditions of probation</strong>, which are requirements that all probationers must observe. Offenders placed on probation must also usually abide by <strong>specific conditions of probation</strong>, which are requirements unique to the individual that the judge imposes at the time of sentencing.</p>

<div class="p-ct">Probation visitations are a key part of probation supervision. Which do you think is more effective: a minimal or intense supervision approach? Why?</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">General conditions of probation are mostly the same from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, while specific conditions are tailored to individual offenders. The nature of general probation conditions and the degree of discretion probation officers have in ensuring offenders adhere to them have been sources of controversy, both in abstract and in practice. These issues will be discussed later in this chapter.</p>

<p class="tx">Another element of probation is supervision. A probationer is monitored, either directly or indirectly, to determine if he or she is complying with the requirements of probation. Supervision is also linked to other purposes, such as protecting society and helping the probationer adhere to the terms of probation. Supervision levels range from minimal to intense, and supervision takes many forms. Some jurisdictions, however, allow for &ldquo;unsupervised probation,&rdquo; wherein the probationer does not have a case worker but must still abide by the terms of probation. One universal term of probation is to remain a &ldquo;law-abiding person&rdquo; during one&rsquo;s term of probation.</p>

<a id="p186"></a>
<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec8.2">8.2&ensp;The History and Development of Probation</h1>

<p class="tx">The correctional concept of conditionally releasing an offender to the community with supervision existed in the United States by the latter half of the 19th century. Probation as it is presently known stems from the extension of discretionary practices established long ago, and blending these with other ideas during what Walker (1980) has called &ldquo;the great institution-building period between 1815 and 1900&rdquo; (pp. 17&ndash;18).</p>

<h2 class="h2">Antecedents of Probation</h2>

<p class="tx">Antecedents of probation include a practice called <strong>benefit of clergy</strong>. The benefit of clergy goes back to the Middle Ages, when clergy members were exempt from many civil punishments. In fact, this practice exempted clergy members from receiving the death penalty in colonial America (Walker, 1980). Gradually, the &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; was extended to laypersons who could demonstrate their piety by either reading or reciting a Bible passage. </p>

<p class="tx"><strong>Judicial reprieve</strong>, another antecedent to probation, &ldquo;permitted judges to temporarily delay the imposition of sentence and to continue to delay upon evidence of good behavior&rdquo; (Walker, 1980, p. 88). Under the concept of judicial reprieve, the judge could sentence a convicted offender but defer imposing the sentence and instead give the offender time in the community, under the watchful eye of the court. If the offender behaved, the judge could suspend the original sentence. If the offender did not behave, the sentence would be imposed.</p>

<p class="tx">Examples of other such practices include &ldquo;an 1836 Massachusetts law [that] authorized security bonds for good behavior as an alternative sentence; the law only ratified practice that extended back many years&rdquo; (Walker, 1980, p. 88). Security bonds consisted of posted money or property to guarantee good behavior. If the offender did not comply with the court&rsquo;s order, the bond was forfeited. Another practice was the <strong>filing of cases</strong>. This was tantamount to what today would be called informal prosecutorial discretion. Prosecutors exercised their discretion to temporarily or permanently suspend prosecution of a case if the accused demonstrated good behavior.</p>

<h2 class="h2">The &ldquo;Father of Probation&rdquo;</h2>

<p class="tx">John Augustus, a court volunteer in the 1840s, had a significant influence on probation in the United States. Focusing on those with alcohol-related problems and on the indigent, Augustus interceded to pay their fines and assist with their recovery and employment. Augustus&rsquo;s efforts contributed to the development of the notion of supervision and to courts monitoring those who are released into the community. </p>

<a id="p187"></a>
<p class="tx">Most of the material written about Augustus is limited; what exists notes his charitable aims and the development of probation under his direction. Some have characterized him as the &ldquo;father of probation&rdquo; (Lindner, 2006, p. 143), while others have criticized his work. Lindner notes that the <em>Daily Print</em>, a local newspaper in Boston, charged him with a &ldquo;great itching for notoriety and dollars,&rdquo; and that he had bled &ldquo;thousands&rdquo; to satisfy his own &ldquo;propensities.&rdquo; Lindner (2006) cites Augustus defending himself against such characterizations and standing firm regarding his appropriate use of the charity that subsidized his efforts: &ldquo;It will, I trust, afford peculiar satisfaction to those who have aided me to know, that the funds which they have contributed have not been misapplied&rdquo; (p. 143). Regardless of such controversy, Augustus continued his probation-related work, directing his early efforts toward male offenders but later extending his work to women and juveniles as well. Augustus died in 1859 in Boston, yet his legacy as the father of probation lives on to this day.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Probation as a Recognized Element of Corrections</h2>

<p class="tx">Other notable developments mark the emersion of probation as an accepted element of corrections. For example, Boston police captain Edward Savage was known for conducting presentence investigations following the mass arrest of prostitutes in 1858 and in 1878 became the first official probation officer (Walker, 1980). <strong>Presentence investigations</strong> were detailed reports put together by an agent of the court documenting a crime, the offender&rsquo;s background, and recommendations to the judge regarding an appropriate sentence. Savage is credited with firmly establishing the presentence investigation as a feature of the probation process. Further support came from those who spoke in favor of individualizing corrections practices at the National Congress on Penitentiary and Reformatory Discipline in 1870.</p>

<p class="tx">With a foundation for probation emerging, and with greater acceptance of its central notions, this criminal justice practice became formally institutionalized. The Massachusetts legislature passed the first probation statute in 1878, followed by a second in 1880. &ldquo;In 1891 Massachusetts created a statewide probation system and transferred power of appointment [of probation officers] from municipal officials to the courts&rdquo; (Walker, 1980, pp. 88&ndash;89). In short, while probation services first emerged at the local level of government, they soon became utilized by many state governments. By 1920 most states had made some level of probation available to offenders.</p>

<p class="tx">The widening probation movement suffered a mild setback in 1916 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <em>Ex parte United States</em> that the federal judiciary, which had been granting probation, had no legal basis to do so&mdash;indeed, no specific legislation existed that authorized this practice. Also known as the Killits decision, named for the federal judge whose practices were being questioned, the <em>Ex parte United States</em> decision resulted in nearly 5,000 pardons being issued to those under federal probation, followed by congressional legislation to authorize federal probation.</p>

<p class="tx">Widespread adoption of probation grew out of the Progressive movement. As Rothman (1980) indicates, the Progressive ideal of achieving low caseloads, developing professional (treatment-oriented) officers, and giving offenders individualized treatment was attractive to many and politically convenient for some. The reality of probation, however, became large caseloads, nonprofessionals (not treatment-oriented), and perfunctory supervision. These problems remain ongoing.</p>

<a id="p188"></a>
<p class="tx">As noted, the use of probation continues to grow in the 21st century. Figure 8.1 depicts the increase in adult probationers in recent years. Although its parameters have changed over time, the basic concepts of probation remain essentially the same. </p>

<div class="box-2">
<h1 class="h1"><strong>Applying Criminal Justice:</strong> <em>The Future of Probation</em></h1>

<p class="tx">Probation has been part of the correctional landscape since the 1840s, and since this time it has had many supporters and critics. In the 1980s critics suggested that probation did not work, since many people on probation were rearrested, even though many did not end up in prison for not following the conditions of their probation. Prison was reserved for the most serious crimes, and probation was reserved for less serious crimes, so while many probationers violated the conditions of their probation, it was not felt that sending them to prison made sense. Evidence started to mount that probation was not meeting the needs of offenders or society, which led to variations in how probation was delivered. Some states employed modern technology to better supervise probationers; other states dedicated more resources to probation departments and prioritized smaller caseloads. However, most states kept probation pretty much the same. </p>

<p class="tx">Research started to reveal the necessity of being more proactive with probation populations (Byrne, Lurigio, &amp; Petersilia, 2005). For example, successful probation required better case management, more rigorous assessment of the risk posed by offenders, more direct supervision of the most seriously threatening probationers, more attention paid to their needs, and better strategies for helping them succeed. The evidence, however, also pointed to the fact that most probationers successfully completed their sentences with very few problems (Petersilia, Turner, Kahan, &amp; Peterson, 1985). This mixed data raises the question of whether probation is effective (Bryan, 1996). </p>

<p class="tx">Most probationers are not considered &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; to society. The typical probationer has a history of substance abuse and/or property crime and typically no record of violence. Given these and other issues, how do we best allocate criminal justice programs&rsquo; limited resources for addressing the diverse risk and individualized needs of probationers? Probation is less expensive than incarceration; does this make it an attractive option for most states? Is it the right choice for, say, drug offenders and low-level property offenders? And will it become more or less widely used in the 21st century?</p>

<p class="tx">Political and practical realities have made probation an established part of corrections. There are many advantages to using this correctional tool to respond to illegal activity.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Advantages of Probation</h2>

<p class="tx">Probation gives the justice system the capacity to absorb large numbers of offenders and place them under varying degrees of supervision. Because probationers remain in the community, they do not suffer the physical and psychological deprivations associated with structured confinement. Offenders on probation may retain their job (or look for work), maintain family and other community ties, continue to support their families, meet other financial obligations (which can, for example, keep creditors paid and help prevent an offender&rsquo;s dependents from turning to the state for material support), make restitution to victims, take advantage of community resources, adjust to a law-abiding lifestyle, and be less prone to suffering the stigma associated with conviction. </p>

<a id="p190"></a>
<p class="tx">It is also argued that probation keeps focus on the community&rsquo;s responsibility and roles in correcting offenders. Additionally, probation can provide a way to deal with those who have committed less serious offenses, are one-time or sporadic offenders, or are judged to be relatively stable or more in need of community assistance than incarceration.</p>

<p class="tx">From a practical standpoint, probation is more economically attractive than incarceration (Wisconsin Taxpayer Alliance, 2010). In California the cost of sending an offender to prison (roughly $164 per day) or jail (about $105 per day) is significantly higher than placing someone on probation (just over $12 per day) (Grattet &amp; Martin, 2015). The numbers vary by state, yet in general, the cost of putting offenders on probation is generally recognized as being far less than the cost of incarcerating them (Petersilia, 2008). In addition, probation has evolved into a major industry that employs tens of thousands of Americans. For further discussion of probation&rsquo;s economic issues, see the feature box <em>Applying Criminal Justice: Should Cost Matter </em><em>in Sentencing Decisions?</em></p>

<h2 class="h2">Disadvantages of Probation</h2>

<p class="tx">Probation may also have disadvantages. Critics of probation usually point out that there is no singular or adequate theoretical base to objectively justify the practice of probation. &ldquo;Probation&rdquo; is not a monolithic correctional approach; rather, the term refers to a collection of strategies. Numerous approaches to probation exist in the United States, such that it is impossible to put forth a universal definition of &ldquo;probation.&rdquo; This makes it difficult to determine whether probation truly constitutes a punishment or if it can achieve rehabilitation and reintegration. In other words, does probation have clearly ascertainable aims or outcomes? Some of these criticisms can be tempered by the standard terms of probation found in nearly all plea agreements. </p>

<p class="tx">Probation usually allows criminal justice officials and <strong>proximate policy makers</strong>, which include legislatures, prosecutors, and judges, to exercise a large degree of discretion. For example, legislatures or other governing bodies provide general parameters for the legitimate use of probation&mdash;usually without recommending specific ways to determine if probation&rsquo;s expected outcomes have been met. Prosecutors often utilize probation as a bargaining tool during plea bargaining, especially when recommending a sentence. Judges may impose probation as a permutation of the sentencing options discussed above. They may use probation for more practical purposes in the event that, say, the offender&rsquo;s crime is marginal and jail or prison space is limited. Probation agencies, both administratively and through probation officers&rsquo; actions, may focus on enforcing rules, assisting probationers, or any other appropriate action. As a result, it may be difficult to ascertain exactly what the primary aim(s) may be in using probation for a particular offender or case, and perhaps even for probation in general. </p>

<div class="p-ct">Plea deals often result in a probation sentencing. In 2010 Paris Hilton pled guilty to cocaine possession in exchange for a year of probation and to avoid a felony charge. Is this an example of sentencing disparity?</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">It may be argued that the large degree of discretion associated with imposing and monitoring probation is itself a disadvantage. Some argue that the problem with probation lies with <strong>sentencing disparity</strong>, when similar offenders receive dissimilar sentences. Others argue that probation depreciates the seriousness of an offense, especially when there is a felony conviction that could result in a rather lengthy incarceration. Generally, these arguments are connected to issues of equity in sentencing, both in the imposition of a sentence and in the actual sentence served (known as the &ldquo;effective sentence&rdquo;). Some also argue that when probation is used as a bargaining advantage in plea negotiations, it distorts due process, where the imposition of probation has more to do with the negotiation than with making decisions based on protecting the offender&rsquo;s constitutional rights.</p>

<p class="tx">There are also those who argue that probation, especially felony probation, presents a societal protection dilemma. Advocates of retribution and deterrence may argue that probationary status does little to deter a convicted offender from committing more crimes and that allowing the offender to be in the community merely gives him or her the opportunity to commit additional crimes (Walker, 2011). For example, in a 40-month follow-up study of felony probationers in California and New York, Petersilia, Turner, Kahan, and Peterson (1985) found that 65% were rearrested, 51% were reconvicted (one third of these for serious violent crimes), and 18% were sent on to institutions. Those interested in societal protection find such statistics important when evaluating the effect of probation. On the other hand, such statistics can be countered by more optimistic findings (see Vito, 1983, 1984; Fichter, Hirschburg, &amp; McGaha, 1987; Worrall, Schram, Hays, &amp; Newman, 2001). Interestingly, more recent data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (2011c) reports that in 2010, 16% of felony probationers had their probation revoked or were incarcerated for a new offense. This number has been fairly consistent since the mid-1980s. It should be noted that the Petersilia et al. study reported in 1985 indicated high rearrest rates, but at the end of the day, 18% of those rearrested were sent to an institution, coming close to the 16% figure reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2011. Depending on one&rsquo;s predisposition, probation outcomes may be seen, more or less, as controversial. According to James (2015), the longer a probationer can remain a law-abiding citizen while on probation, the less likely it is that he or she will reoffend (see Figure 8.2).</p>

<div class="box-2">
<h1 class="h1"><strong>Applying Criminal Justice:</strong> <em>Should Cost Matter in </em><em>Sentencing&nbsp;Decisions?</em></h1>

<p class="tx">Probation as a sentencing option has been offered as a pragmatic alternative to imprisonment. Research has demonstrated that the cost of probation is dramatically less than the cost of incarceration (United States Courts, 2013). In some states the difference between a probation disposition and prison disposition is enormous; it can be 6 to 10 times less costly to put someone on probation than to send him or her to prison. The question, however, is whether cost should drive sentencing decisions.</p>

<a id="p193"></a>
<p class="tx">Research has shown that because of limited resources and burgeoning caseloads, most probationers are minimally supervised. Yet this may not be problematic, since most probationers do not require intensive supervision and can function with limited intervention. It must be wondered whether an offender who does not &ldquo;need incarceration&rdquo; can be adequately held accountable and sufficiently punished by being placed on probation. Do people on probation actually &ldquo;pay&rdquo; for their offenses? How much pain should they have to endure given the fact that their crimes were not that serious? How do we weigh the costs and allure of probation as a sentencing decision when compared to the punishment often required for the crime and the need to keep society safe? What about probationers who repeatedly violate their probation or do not follow its conditions? What effect does prison overcrowding have on probation-related decision making? Since many states have serious problems with prison overcrowding and probation is viewed as a practical alternative, is it in society&rsquo;s interest for correctional systems to avoid revoking people&rsquo;s probation, even if they deserve to have it revoked? What about sentencing someone to a combination of probation and jail time? Judges have used this combination for decades. Will this approach become more prevalent as states search for ways to reduce correctional costs while trying to achieve a multitude of correctional aims?</p>
</div>

<br/>
<h1 class="h1" id="sec8.4">8.4&ensp;The Structure and Operation of Probation Agencies</h1>

<p class="tx">In the United States probation is administered by more than 2,000 agencies (Abadinsky, 2012). Agencies are organized at federal, state, and local levels of government. As has been noted regarding correctional administration and organization in general (see Chapter 6), these agencies are not part of a large pyramid that coordinates, controls, or allocates resources. The agencies that provide probation services operate independently within varying contexts and are administratively connected to and funded by many different governing bodies. One can expect to find a good deal of commonality but also different aims, policies, funding, staffing, and operations resulting from the various contexts within which probation agencies are administered.</p>

<p class="tx">Abadinsky (2012) points out that probation system administration can be separated into six categories:</p>

<ol class="nl">
<li class="nl"><em>Juvenile</em>: Separate probation services for juveniles are administered on a county or municipal level or on a statewide basis.</li>
<li class="nl"><em>Municipal</em>: Independent probation units are administered by the lower courts under both state and local laws and guidelines.</li>
<li class="nl"><em>County</em>: Under laws and guidelines established by the state, a county operates its own probation system, similar to the municipal system.</li>
<li class="nl"><em>State</em>: One agency administers a central probation system, which provides services throughout the state.</li>
<li class="nl"><em>State combined</em>: Probation and parole services are administered on a statewide basis by one agency.</li>
<li class="nl"><em>Federal</em>: Probation is administered throughout the country as an arm of the courts. Federal probation officers also supervise parolees.</li>
</ol>

<div class="p-ct">Juveniles on probation build a museum exhibit as part of a training program conducted by the Mohave County Probation Department. What would be the specific aim of this probation service?</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">It is important to point out that within states, probation services may reflect variations of these power structures and practices. Each state contains people who are under U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services supervision because they violated the United States Criminal Code. Others are under the supervision of a state-level authority, such as a state department of corrections&rsquo; probation division, while others are under the supervision of separate county, municipal, and juvenile agencies, where those exist. In other words, the probationer population in any given state may have persons supervised by different agencies that may pursue different policies, provide different levels of service, have different staffing patterns, and so on. Thus, the realities of probation for these probationers and probation workers may be very different.</p>

<p class="tx">Even though a vast majority of states operate probation at the state level and provide services throughout the states (State of California, Legislative Analyst Office, 2009), a decentralized structure of probation is common across the country. This decentralization exists by level and across branches of government; probation agencies are organized within both the executive and the judicial branches, depending on the controlling jurisdiction. A good deal of attention has been paid to the benefits and drawbacks of placing probation agencies within either the executive or the judicial branches.</p>

<p class="tx">The current organizational arrangements have resulted from of a focus on form (administrative identity and interest, budgetary and policy control, the appearance of and symbolism associated with structure) over function (precisely identified objectives such as anticipated or actual outputs of &ldquo;probation&rdquo;). Do such arguments deflect attention away from more substantive issues concerning what can be accomplished from the sets of strategies known as &ldquo;probation&rdquo;? Do political realities associated with the organization and operation of probation preclude meaningful consideration of coherent development from a &ldquo;national perspective&rdquo;? These are important questions regarding the administration of probation agencies.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Probation Field Offices</h2>

<p class="tx">Probation field offices are the basic service-delivery units for probation. Whether organized at the federal, state, or local level, these agencies carry out many tasks. As noted, these agencies vary in terms of staffing, funding, operational policies, and in the extent and types of services provided. One must keep this variation in mind while considering the practices associated with probation. </p>

<a id="p195"></a>
<p class="tx">As discussed in Chapter 7, probation is a primary element in community corrections, and those who work in probation have significant discretion. Probation officers may be involved in preconviction and postconviction phases of the criminal justice process. Depending on an agency&rsquo;s organization, probation officers may be both probation and parole officers, providing services to both probationers and parolees.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Pretrial Services</h2>

<p class="tx">Some probation agencies provide pretrial diversion services, particularly varying degrees of pretrial supervision. Similarly, in recent years, some probation agencies have begun providing pretrial services in connection with bail projects, including screening those who may be eligible for release from custody and providing varying degrees of pretrial supervision. Some probation agencies carry out duties related to juvenile probation. In addition to supervision, pretrial services might include employment programming and treatment initiatives for specific issues, including drug treatment interventions. The goal of pretrial services is to provide an initial assessment of offenders prior to trial, while at the same time maintaining contact with them to ensure they appear for court hearings to determine a final disposition.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Investigation Services</h2>

<p class="tx">Probation agencies also provide presentence investigation and <strong>postsentence investigation</strong>. These reports are developed during either the preconviction phase or the postconviction phase of the criminal justice process. Recall that a presentence investigation is a formal report concerning an offender and the circumstances of the offense. It is developed primarily to help the court make an appropriate disposition and provide information for further decision making concerning the offender. The postsentence investigation is also developed to provide information for further decision making concerning the offender. Abadinsky (2012) notes that these reports may also</p>

<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">serve as the basis for a plan of probation,</li>
<li class="bl">assist jail or prison personnel in classification and program decisions, and</li>
<li class="bl">assist in parole decision making.</li>
</ul>

<p class="tx">Probation agencies typically have a general format for developing a presentence investigation. Such an investigation typically includes the crime committed and the offender&rsquo;s prior record and personal background, but the document can vary across agencies and jurisdictions. Developing a presentence investigation usually requires a probation officer to conduct interviews, review records, and consider other documents. Depending on the offender and the offense, the investigation may be quite extensive and time-consuming. In many jurisdictions, judges ask probation officers for sentencing recommendations and an evaluation of the case overall. In some jurisdictions, judges prefer not to have a recommendation, just the information and an overall evaluation or summary. In either situation, probation officers bear primary responsibility for presenting the information and for the tone of the report. The information and ways in which it is presented can influence the disposition of a case, as well as other decisions.</p>

<a id="p196"></a>
<p class="tx">If probation officers have both probationers and parolees in their caseloads, they may also develop preparole investigations. These are similar to presentence investigation s but are developed specifically to use in parole decision making&mdash;whether to grant parole and any other decisions regarding the parolee. McCleary (1978) notes that parole officers (POs) have a &ldquo;typical&rdquo; attitude toward such reports. In a groundbreaking study, he found that POs use preparole investigations as part of a <em>typing</em> process, categorizing offenders generally in terms of <em>control</em>, developing reports in a routine (almost perfunctory) manner by focusing on a few key issues. According to McCleary, POs understand that offenders will be released into different environments. Therefore, the PO&rsquo;s main focus is to establish the offender&rsquo;s controllability in relation to his or her potential environment, rather than to provide a comprehensive assessment of the individual and offense. Here again, one must consider the large diversity among agencies, probation/parole personnel, offenders and circumstances, and the increasing demand that probation/parole personnel do more with less. Remember that probation is best envisioned as a set of strategies; offenders&rsquo; and probation/parole officers&rsquo; experiences may be similar in some respects but vary significantly. Harris, Gingerich, and Whitaker (2004) report that probation officers&rsquo; supervision styles tend to be inconsistent with strategies recommended by an assessment tool. Training and tools affect how probation officers supervise their charges. </p>

<p class="tx">Developing presentence investigations and other investigation reports takes up a great deal of a probation agency&rsquo;s time and effort. Criticisms of such efforts generally center on the amount of time and energy devoted to these activities in relation to caseload supervision, as well as the quality of information included and the leeway available to probation officers to present information (Rosecrance, 2010). In states where mandatory sentencing guidelines are adopted, there may well be need for only a brief or perhaps no presentence investigation, given the nature of the sentencing process under such guidelines. Furthermore, the utility of presentence investigations is called into question by some, who point out that judges are not bound to base their decisions on the investigation&rsquo;s information or recommendations. The observation that dispositions are often in accord with presentence investigation reports may counter such criticism; perhaps presentence investigations are usually well done; perhaps probation officers become well acquainted with the details of cases in their jurisdictions and develop presentence investigations in accord with their perceptions; or perhaps both are true. The actual value of a presentence investigation appears difficult to determine. </p>

<h2 class="h2">Supervision</h2>

<p class="tx">As noted earlier, supervision is an essential element of probation. Probation supervision can serve many purposes, including community protection, rule enforcement, and offender assistance. There is no singular or universally accepted theory underlying probation supervision. Various service roles for probation agencies and probation officers have been conceptualized and associated with supervision. Approaches to service roles and supervision may vary from agency to agency, from officer to officer, and even from offender to offender (perhaps dependent on the offender&rsquo;s perceived needs or other factors). </p>

<p class="tx">In practice, probation officers are assigned a caseload to supervise. Caseloads can vary depending on the agencies&rsquo; or offenders&rsquo; needs or circumstances, probation officers&rsquo; abilities, and more. Caseloads may be <strong>generalized caseloads</strong> or <strong>specialized caseloads</strong>. Generalized caseloads are those in which the probation officer supervises a variety of offenders and offense types. Specialized caseloads are made up of offenders who share common characteristics or offenses.</p>

<a id="p197"></a>
<p class="tx">Supervising offenders involves directly interacting with or monitoring them; it can also involve indirect monitoring. Probation officers may be required to supervise offenders directly, through <strong>personal visits</strong> (interacting with the offender at the probation office, the probationer&rsquo;s residence, or another place) or through <strong>collateral visits</strong> (interactions with others, such as employers, family members, or acquaintances who can provide information about the offender&rsquo;s progress). Probation officers may be required to supervise offenders indirectly by reading reports they submit, monitoring jail lists to determine whether anyone in the caseload has been arrested, or otherwise determining the progress of the probationer. Supervision also involves documenting the offender&rsquo;s progress; this can require an officer to regularly complete a lot of paperwork about the people on the caseload. </p>

<div class="p-ct">A probation officer&#39;s supervision technique may incorporate unscheduled visits to offenders so that they can be observed more spontaneously. Here, probation officers check on recently released sex offenders in a temporary-housing apartment.</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">Probationers are often sorted by status for the purposes of supervision. This may be done formally, using some type of <strong>risk/needs assessment</strong>, or more informally, such as when probation officers, due to caseload demands, must decide on whom to focus their efforts. Degrees of supervision may vary from minimum (when a probationer is only loosely or indirectly supervised) to intensive (when special efforts are made to provide direct supervision). There has been much debate regarding the efficacy of risk and needs assessment instruments. The science behind these instruments has steadily improved, however, and their practical application is widely utilized in probation departments across the country (Abadinsky, 2012). </p>

<p class="tx">There are many elements to effective risk/needs assessment instruments, and their dimensions are complicated. Risk assessments focus on the degree to which a probationer poses a danger to the community and his or her likelihood of recidivating (committing another crime). Needs assessments, on the other hand, are not about dangers or possible threats posed, but rather focus on what is necessary for the probationer to succeed in the community.</p>

<p class="tx">The probation officer can determine which supervision strategy will be most effective by assessing the offender&rsquo;s risks and needs. The trick is to find appropriate and limited resources that can both enhance public safety and address the needs of the probationer. </p>

<a id="p198"></a>
<p class="tx">One way to determine a probationer&rsquo;s risks and needs is to identify <strong>variables of interest</strong>, or those variables relevant to effectively supervising a probationer. Research has identified the following variables as being predictive of probationers&rsquo; recidivism (Eisenberg, Bryl, &amp; Fabelo, 2009): age at first conviction, number of prior probation/parole revocations, number of prior felony convictions, juvenile convictions, prior involvement or placement on probation/parole supervision, record of assaultive behavior, number of address changes in the previous 12 months, employment in the previous 12 months, alcohol problems, drug problems, and attitude. A risk assessment assigns quantitative scores to each variable and calculates a total score based on the variables relevant to the probationer. The total score is than placed within a supervision range (i.e., &ldquo;reduced supervision,&rdquo; &ldquo;regular supervision,&rdquo; &ldquo;close supervision,&rdquo; and &ldquo;intensive supervision&rdquo;). The supervision range suggests the degree of supervision required to safely manage the probationer in the community and minimize the risk to the&nbsp;public.</p>

<p class="tx">Risk assessment is a serious task for probation officers. As agents of the court, they are required to maintain a vigilant posture and address any threats to the community&rsquo;s security and safety. It is not unreasonable for probation officers to be conservative in their assessment and management of risk. In most cases, probation officers will have a mix of supervision levels in their caseloads and limited resources with which to monitor all of their probationers. The conservative view would encourage many probation officers to focus more time and energy on those probationers who pose the greatest risk to the community, reducing or virtually eliminating supervision of the least problematic probationers. </p>

<p class="tx">Risk is only one side of the probation officer&rsquo;s responsibility. What about needs? The most significant probationer needs include academic vocation skills, employment, financial management, marital/family relationships, companionship, emotional stability, treatment for alcohol and drug use, mental ability, physical health, sexual behavior, recreation and hobbies, and the probation officer&rsquo;s impression of client needs. Similar to the risk assessment, a needs assessment establishes a quantitative score for each of these variables of interest to produce a total score. This score guides decision making regarding the probationer&rsquo;s supervision.</p>

<p class="tx">Composite risk and needs scores are compared, and the dimension with the highest score determines the supervision level required for the probationer. Risk/needs assessment instruments have been touted as one of the major advances in the corrections field. All 50 states use some established instrument to assess probationers and determine the most appropriate form of supervision. Although research has demonstrated the usefulness and value of risk/needs assessment instruments in making probation supervision more effective and efficient (National Council on Crime and Delinquency, 2012), the process is not without controversy.</p>

<p class="tx">A major concern with risk/assessment instruments centers on the variable of <strong>professional override</strong> and the ability to appropriately provide the recommended supervision. Professional override occurs when a probation officer determines there are additional concerns that were not reflected in the other variables of interest identified in the probationer&rsquo;s risk and/or needs areas; these concerns may become more important in the final determination of a supervision strategy. For example, a probation officer may feel that the probationer requires more supervision due to his or her demeanor, attitude, and past interactions. The officer may deal with probationers who misrepresent certain facts regarding their situation. Probation officers are guided by experience and insight to determine how best to supervise those on their caseload. As a part of professional override, the probation officer may feel that some of the risk/assessment data is useful but that it inadequately captures what is required to maintain an appropriate level of supervision . Since probation work is &ldquo;people work,&rdquo; we have to respect the probation agent&rsquo;s value and judgment; yet we also want to be sensitive to the information provided by the risk/needs assessment instrument. The balance between the supervision level recommended by an objective assessment instrument and the probation officer&rsquo;s knowledge and experience is critical to effective supervision.</p>

<a id="p199"></a>
<p class="tx">It can be difficult for probation officers to determine the appropriate balance between the risk posed by and the needs of an offender. It is not uncommon for probation officers to routinize their supervision of probationers; offenders often get &ldquo;typed&rdquo; into certain categories for the purposes of supervision (Rosecrance, 2010). In this way, probation officers can efficiently allocate limited resources to those who need them the most. The difficulty arises when there is such a strong emphasis on minimizing risk to the community that probation officers are unwilling to embrace programming (needs based) that may prove helpful to the supervision process (Ferguson, 2010).</p>

<p class="tx">The extent to which supervision may facilitate either community protection or therapeutic assistance to probationers, or both, is controversial. Most probation officers have large caseloads that typically involve 100 or more probationers per officer. Given that probation officers may be involved in a variety of tasks&mdash;including investigative work (e.g., developing presentence investigations), preparing documentation for their caseloads, carrying out activities to maintain their agencies (attending staff meetings, etc.), traveling in the field to meet with probationers and others, and making appearances concerning revocations&mdash;critics of probation often argue that there is little time left over for actual supervision.</p>

<p class="tx">Many departments now have special probation programs that focus supervision efforts on those offenders judged to be high risk, usually felony offenders. This strategy involves assigning a small caseload to each probation officer and requiring more frequent contacts between officer and offender. Another strategy, <strong>intensive probation</strong>, involves concentrating supervision resources on a relatively small proportion of probationers. Such strategies have practical appeal, but convincing evidence of their viability have not yet been produced (Walker, 2011).</p>

<h2 class="h2">Revocation</h2>



<p class="tx">When probationers do not successfully complete the terms of their probation, their probation officers may have to initiate revocation proceedings. Probationers who commit a crime while on probation, as well as those who violate the general or specific conditions of their probation (called &ldquo;technical violations&rdquo; of probation)&mdash;even if their acts or omissions would not constitute a new crime&mdash;may face revocation. Revocation hearings are subject to minimum due process guarantees outlined in the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in the cases <em>Morrissey v. </em><em>Brewer</em> (1972) and <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli</em> (1973). State legislatures may impose stricter requirements for hearings subject to their respective governing authorities.</p>

<div class="p-ct">When an offender violates his or her probation, it is the probation officer&#39;s duty to initiate revocation proceedings. This woman is accused of violating her probation and is being escorted into a revocation hearing.</div>
</div>

<p class="tx">Revocation usually involves a process similar to the following.</p>

<a id="p200"></a>



<ul class="bl">
<li class="bl">The probation officer initiates the process by formally alleging a violation of probation.</li>
<li class="bl">The allegation is reviewed by a senior probation supervisor, who conducts a preliminary examination or hearing.</li>
<li class="bl">The probationer may waive a formal preliminary hearing.</li>
<li class="bl">If sufficient reason is found to request a formal revocation hearing, such a request is sent to the court of appropriate jurisdiction.</li>
<li class="bl">The revocation hearing is held before a judge, is more or less adversarial in nature (depending on the extension of due process guarantees beyond those required by the U.S. Supreme Court), and the result depends on the judge&rsquo;s decision regarding the evidence presented.</li>
</ul>

<p class="tx">Note that in a probation violation hearing, the burden of proof for the state is always less than beyond a reasonable doubt, as is required in criminal cases. Jurisdictions vary from a preponderance of the evidence (civil law standard) to clear and convincing evidence.</p>

<p class="tx">In general, if a judge finds that the probationer has violated probation, several options are available. The judge could </p>

<ul class="bl"><li class="bl">decide to issue a verbal or written formal reprimand and continue the offender on probation;</li>
<li class="bl">impose new or additional special conditions as requirements and continue the offender on probation; or</li>
<li class="bl">revoke probation and reinstate the penalties on the underlying criminal charges, up to and including a maximum sentence for jail or prison, fines, and other penalties.</li>
</ul>

<p class="tx">Obviously, if the judge finds that the probationer did not violate probation, the offender continues with the previous terms and conditions of probation.</p>

<p class="tx">As outlined above, supervision and revocation form the bulk of the postconviction tasks. It should be noted that a number of special programs, such as electronic monitoring and other creative programs (discussed in Chapter 7), are also associated with probation. </p>

<a id="p201"></a>
<br/>
<h1 class="eoc-h1" id="ch08Conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>

<p class="tx">Probation is a relatively recent development in corrections. Probation may best be understood as a collection of strategies. While common tactics&mdash;such as release to the community, conditions, and supervision&mdash;may broadly outline the notion of probation, the experience of probation varies widely. The use of probation, especially felony probation, is rapidly expanding. As a sentencing option, probation may be a sentence in and of itself, or it may be used to suspend the imposition or execution of a sentence. As a correctional rubric, probation is multidimensional, with many combinations of practices falling under the general label. </p>

<p class="tx">Probation allows numerous offenders to be placed under correctional authority at substantially lower costs than incarceration. Variations on the practice of probation, notably intensive probation, have been promoted to counter concerns about societal protection and other issues. Probation will remain a major part of correctional systems for years to come. It has been viewed as a major component of corrections in the United States and will continue to evolve through the 21st century.</p>
